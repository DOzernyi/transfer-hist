	abstract = {Many contemporary papers debate what linguistics transfer is, what it entails, and how it comes around. In an attempt to shed some light at these questions, we set out to investigate the journey of linguistic transfer from the time it appeared in psychology (1890s), through its ingress to modern generative linguistics (late 1940s), and up to the present. Concluding, we connect Robert Lado’s Contrastive Analysis and his use of the word to the obscurity which followed transfer into the modern day. Lastly, we offer some thoughts for moving forward in transfer studies.},

	abstract = {Rating scale design and development for testing speaking is generally conducted using one of two approaches: the measurement-driven approach or the performance data-driven approach. The measurement-driven approach prioritizes the ordering of descriptors onto a single scale. Meaning is derived from the scaling methodology and the agreement of trained judges as to the place of any descriptor on the scale. The performance data-driven approach, on the other hand, places primary value upon observations of language performance, and attempts to describe performance in sufficient detail to generate descriptors that bear a direct relationship with the original observations of language use. Meaning is derived from the link between performance and description. We argue that measurement-driven approaches generate impoverished descriptions of communication, while performance data-driven approaches have the potential to provide richer descriptions that offer sounder inferences from score meaning to performance in specified domains. With reference to original data and the literature on travel service encounters, we devise a new scoring instrument, a Performance Decision Tree (PDT). This instrument prioritizes what we term ‘performance effect’ by explicitly valuing and incorporating performance data from a specific communicative context. We argue that this avoids the reification of ordered scale descriptors which we find in measurement-driven scale construction for speaking tests.},

Instead, we support the Prosodic Transfer Hypothesis, which argues that the ultimate attainment of L2 speakers is constrained by L1 prosodic representations; these representations can, however, be minimally adapted to accommodate the needs of the L2 under certain conditions. We investigate the L2 acquisition of English by 10 Mandarin speakers, by means of an experiment involving judgement and production of tense and participial morphology. Mandarin lacks overt tense inflection, while English inflection is represented by adjunction to the Prosodic Word, an option not available in Mandarin. We show that Mandarin speakers have few problems interpreting English tense appropriately, contrary to the predictions of the Representational Deficit Hypothesis. A detailed analysis is offered of their production of the morphology, which motivates the claim that the prosodic representation required for regular inflection in English can be built by combining licensing relations available in Mandarin. We conclude that target-like prosodic representations are ultimately attainable for at least some functional material which is absent from the L1.},

Selective data from trilingual adults (bilingual Italian/German learners of English) on their use of certain problem-solving behaviour in think-aloud protocols during the process of academic writing are shown to provide evidence of certain processes taking place while performing in a third language. At the same time, this study of metalinguistic thinking isused to point to applied perspectives of research on third language acquisition, going beyond second language research. It is argued that prior language knowledge should be reactivated in the language classroom and that consequently multilingual education should also focus on the similarities between languages in order to increase metalinguistic awareness in both teachers and students.},

	abstract = {The present article addresses the following question: what variables condition syntactic transfer? Evidence is provided in support of the position that third language (L3) transfer is selective, whereby, at least under certain conditions, it is driven by the typological proximity of the target L3 measured against the other previously acquired linguistic systems (cf. Rothman and Cabrelli Amaro, 2007, 2010; Rothman, 2010; Montrul et al., 2011). To show this, we compare data in the domain of adjectival interpretation between successful first language (L1) Italian learners of English as a second language (L2) at the low to intermediate proficiency level of L3 Spanish, and successful L1 English learners of L2 Spanish at the same levels for L3 Brazilian Portuguese. The data show that, irrespective of the L1 or the L2, these L3 learners demonstrate target knowledge of subtle adjectival semantic nuances obtained via noun-raising, which English lacks and the other languages share. We maintain that such knowledge is transferred to the L3 from Italian (L1) and Spanish (L2) respectively in light of important differences between the L3 learners herein compared to what is known of the L2 Spanish performance of L1 English speakers at the same level of proficiency (see, for example, Judy et al., 2008; Rothman et al., 2010). While the present data are consistent with Flynn et al.’s (2004) Cumulative Enhancement Model, we discuss why a coupling of these data with evidence from other recent L3 studies suggests necessary modifications to this model, offering in its stead the Typological Primacy Model (TPM) for multilingual transfer.},

Whether a learning algorithm is capable of matching the achievements of child learners depends in part on how much parametric ambiguity there is in the input. For practical reasons this cannot be established for the domain of all natural languages. Our tactic is to estimate the incidence of unambiguous triggers by examining a constructed domain of languages whose syntactic parameters and structural properties are precisely specified. We succeeded in identifying unambiguous triggers for all non-default parameter values in all languages in this domain. In order to do so, we had to invoke between-parameter relations which disambiguate triggers that otherwise would have been parametrically ambiguous. The discovery of unambiguous triggers in this artificial domain does not prove a sufficiency in natural languages, but it may revive investigation of the psychological plausibility of deterministic models of human language acquisition.},

In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound “derivation chain” between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology’s reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

Block (2003) similarly supports a ‘more interdisciplinary and socially informed orientation’ to second language acquisition. But Block wants to reform rather than replace certain assumptions of what he represents as the best existing theory of second language acquisition, namely, Susan Gass’ Input-Interaction-Output model (IIO model). Jordan (2004), on the other hand, argues forcefully that theorizing about second language acquisition must be based on a rationalist epistemology. He provides a set of ‘Guidelines’ for theory construction, including six assumptions foundational to rationalist inquiry in general, and a five-point evaluation metric against which rival theories can be judged. He also passes on a list of six ‘practices to be avoided’. Jordan encourages the cultivation of many, varied, theories so long as they observe the rationalist Guidelines. He goes on to criticize a broad sample of L2 research, commenting on whether specific proposals do or do not adhere to the Guidelines. This article reviews all three scholars’ positions in this important debate, which has the potential to sharpen second language theorists’ sense of what they are doing and how they should do it.},

	abstract = {In this article, I argue that first language (L1), second language (L2) and third language (L3) acquisition are fundamentally the same process, based on learning by parsing. Both child and adult learners are sensitive to fine linguistic distinctions, and language development takes place in small steps. While the bulk of the article focuses on crosslinguistic influence in L2/Ln acquisition, I first briefly outline the Micro-cue Model of L1 acquisition (Westergaard, 2009a, 2014), arguing that children build their I-language grammars incrementally, paying attention to small distinctions in syntax and information structure from early on. They are also shown to be conservative learners, generally not producing overt elements or performing movement operations unless there is positive evidence for this in the input, thus minimizing the need for unlearning. I then ask the question how this model fares with respect to multilingual situations, more specifically L2 and L3 acquisition. Discussing both theoretical and empirical evidence, I argue that, although L2 and L3 learners are different from L1 children in that they are not always conservative learners, they are also sensitive to fine linguistic distinctions, in that transfer/crosslinguistic influence takes place on a property-by-property basis. Full Transfer is traditionally understood as wholesale transfer at the initial state of L2 acquisition. However, I argue that it is impossible to distinguish between wholesale and property-by-property transfer in L2 acquisition on empirical grounds. In L3 acquisition, on the other hand, crosslinguistic influence from both previously acquired languages would provide support for property-by-property transfer. I discuss a few such cases and argue for what I call Full Transfer Potential (FTP), rather than Full (wholesale) Transfer, within the Linguistic Proximity Model (LPM) of L3 acquisition. Thus, rather than assuming that ‘everything does transfer’, I argue that ‘anything may transfer’.},

Copas has studied two forms of robust estimator: A robust-resistant estimate of Pregibon and an estimate based on a misclassification model. He concluded that robust-resistant estimates are much more biased in small samples than the usual logistic estimate is and recommends a bias-corrected version of the misclassification estimate. We show that there are other versions of robust-resistant estimates which have bias often approximately the same as and sometimes even less than the logistic estimate; these estimates belong to the Mallows class. In addition, the corrected misclassification estimate is inconsistent at the logistic model; we develop a simple consistent modification. The modified estimate is a member of the Mallows class but, unlike most robust estimates, it has an interpretable tuning constant. The results are illustrated on data sets featuring different kinds of outliers.},

	abstract = {This study investigated factors that could affect inter-examiner reliability in the pronunciation assessment component of speaking tests. We hypothesized that the rating of pronunciation is susceptible to variation in assessment due to the amount of exposure examiners have to nonnative English accents. An inter-rater variability analysis was conducted on the English pronunciation ratings of three test candidate interlanguages: Chinese, Korean, and Indian English. Pronunciation was rated by 99 International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examiners across five geographically dispersed test centres. The examiners had either prolonged exposure, or no, or little exposure to the interlanguage of the candidates. A significant proportion of examiners rated pronunciation higher when they had prolonged exposure, and lower when they had no, or little, exposure to the candidates’ interlanguage. The location of the test centre also had a significant effect on the pronunciation rating, independent of the familiarity variable, with a significant proportion of NNS raters scoring candidates from their home country higher than those who were not. It is recommended that interlanguage phonology familiarity should be considered in the design of speaking tests and rater training and that research is required into test centre bias and the phonological judgements and awareness of OPI raters.},

	abstract = {This article investigates verb placement, especially Verb second (V2), in post-puberty second language (L2) learners of two closely related Germanic V2 languages: Swedish and German. Håkansson, et al. (2002) have adduced data from first language (L1) Swedish-speaking learners of German in support of the claim that the syntactic property of V2 never transfers from the L1 to L2 interlanguage grammars. Regardless of L1, learners are said to follow a hypothe-sized universal developmental path of L2 German verb placement, where V2 is mastered very late (only after Object–Verb, OV, has been acquired), if ever. Explanations include the notion of Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) being a more basic, ‘canonical’ word order (e.g. Clahsen and Muysken, 1986), so-called ‘vulnerability’ of the C-domain (Platzack, 2001), and ‘processability’, according to which SVX and Adv–SVX (i.e. V3) are easier to process (i.e. produce) than XVS (i.e. V2) (e.g. Pienemann, 1998). However, the empirical data comes exclusively from Swedes learning German as a third language, after substantial exposure to English. When these learners violate V2, syntactic transfer from English, a non-V2 language, cannot be ruled out. In order to control for this potential confound, I compare new oral production data from six adult Swedish ab initio learners of German, three with prior knowledge of English and three without. With an appropriate elicitation method, the informants can be shown to productively use non-subject-initial V2 in their German after four months of exposure, at a point when their interlanguage syntax elsewhere is non-targetlike (VO instead of OV). Informants who do not know English never violate V2 (0\%), indicating transfer of V2-L1 syntax. Those with prior knowledge of English are less targetlike in their L3-German productions (45\% V2 violations), indicating interference from non-V2 English. These results suggest that, contra Håkansson et al. (2002), learners do transfer the property of V2 from their L1, and that L2 knowledge of a non-V2 language (English) may obscure this V2 transfer. The findings also suggest that V2 is not difficult to acquire per se, and that V2 is not developmentally dependent on target headedness of the VP (German OV) having been acquired first.},

Julien's (2000) large-scale survey of the languages of the world, however, indicates that this word order is never found. This striking gap suggests that the theory of how verbs are related to tense needs to be rethought. I suggest that the gap can be explained by abandoning Chomsky's (1993, 1995) checking theory, in which the relationship between the T node and the inflected verb can be established abstractly. The correct word order typology follows if the computational system of human language can combine tense and verb only by overt head movement (Baker 1988, Pollock 1989) or by the PF merger of morphemes under adjacency (Marantz 1988, Bobaljik 1994).},

	abstract = {Much of the recent debate that has surrounded the development and use of 'performance', or 'communicative' language tests has focused on a supposed trade-off between two sets of desirable qualities: correspondence between test tasks and test performance to nontest language use for content relevance; and reliability of scores derived from test performance. One area that has been of particular concern with performance tests is the potential variability in tasks and rater judgements, and this has been investigated in the language testing literature with two complementary approaches: generalizability the ory and many faceted Rasch modelling. GENOVA, which performs general izability theory analyses, estimates the relative contribution of variation in test tasks and rater judgements to variation in test scores. FACETS, which performs many faceted Rasch modelling, estimates differences in task difficulty and rater severity, and adjusts ability estimates of test takers, taking these differences into account. In this article we first discuss the design and development of a foreign language (Spanish) test battery that was designed for two purposes: first, to place University of California Education Abroad students into programmes at universities abroad that are appropriate for their level of language ability, and secondly to provide diagnostic information that will be useful for designing appropriate teaching and learning pro grammes for prospective education abroad students. The test battery consists of four subtests: reading, listening and note-taking, speaking, and writing. All subtests share a common theme or topic, and are interdependent. We then discuss the results of the GENOVA and FACETS analyses of the speaking subtest, based on a full field trial with a group of University of California undergraduate students who had been selected for participation in the Education Abroad Program. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the use of G-theory and many faceted Rasch modelling for the development of performance tests of foreign language ability.},

We tested perception via a forced-choice goodness task and production via a delayed repetition task. First, we assessed acquisition of the phonological property in BP (in this case, word-final vowel reduction, and excluded learners? data that was not target-like in BP. We then tested the learners? Spanish to determine the level of BP influence.Data and analysis:Perception data were analyzed for accuracy and reaction time. Production data were analyzed acoustically for formant structure, duration, and intensity. We compared L1 English/L2 Spanish data (n=15) with L1 Spanish/L2 English data (n=8), and with Spanish (n=11) and BP controls (n=14).Findings/Conclusions:While data from the preference task do not signal instability of perception for early or late acquirers of Spanish, L2 Spanish production data for vowel height measured differs from the L1 Spanish and Spanish control data. We take this as preliminary support for our hypothesis.Originality:By comparing L1 and L2 vulnerability to L3 influence, this study takes a novel approach to the debate over the constitution of phonological systems acquired in childhood versus in adulthood.Significance/Implications:The novel methodology implemented, together with these empirical findings, will afford further development of a research program dedicated to L3 bidirectional influence and the study of what L3 acquisition can tell us about language acquisition more generally.},

The model is driven by parsing and dictates that the first language (L1) or second language (L2) structure which is hypothesized to be most similar to the L3 structure will be the one to transfer.},

I provide detailed argumentation that the tag involves movement of a correlate of the wh-phrase, followed by ellipsis of the remnant, thus contributing to the growing body of evidence that sentence fragments (sluicing, fragment answers, etc.) are syntactically full clauses. The syntax proposed provides a simple account of the intonation patterns found in split questions and of their semantics. Furthermore, it is argued that the only existing alternative analysis of split questions cannot account for many of the properties of this construction.},

	abstract = {Extrapolation from laboratory experiments to real life learning situations is not a scientifically rigorous process. Nevertheless, it is possible to be systematic without at the same time being rigid about the manner in which additions to knowledge are made. The analysis of transfer effects in second language learning should be molecular and have a systematic character that could potentially organize the knowledge language teachers have developed through their experience in the classroom. The analysis presented in the paper outlines some specific transfer expectations under four different conditions of second language acquisition: coordinate and compound training for related and unrelated languages. Some unexpected predictions are generated; for example, with related languages a compound setting will yield more positive transfer (hence be more facilitative) than a coordinate setting. Similarities between two languages in terms of their surface features are more relevant to the operation of transfer effects than deep structure relations. A distinction must be made between structural factors based on contrastive analyses and non-structural factors pertaining to the learner's attitudes and the sociolinguistic context of the learning situation. Transfer effects operate at various levels of language functioning (e.g., mechanical skills, semantic sensitivity, communicative competence) and measures to assess these effects are suggested.},

	abstract = {The meaning ascribed to select English spatial prepositions by adult English speakers was compared to that of advanced adult ESL learners. Two measures were used: a semantic-relatedness test and a cloze-type/sentence-completion test. The ESL learners differed substantially from the native speakers in the semantic boundaries they ascribed to the words. The differences derived from a different weighting of the words' semantic dimensions. The weighting of the words'semantic dimensions by the ESL learners was influenced by native-language transfer. The words' usage was related to the degree of similarity in the linguistic classification of corresponding meanings in the L1 and the L2 and the consequent conceptual restructuring required in the acquisition of the L2 words. The meaning ascribed to central members of the semantic category investigated more closely approximated that of native speakers than the meaning assigned to noncentral ones. The findings are shown to be related to the similar linguistic classification of central concepts of semantic categories across languages and the language-specific classification of noncentral ones. The findings are interpreted as evidence that the principle of prototypicality underlies the structure of all languages as well as the cognitive processes involved in language acquisition.},

	abstract = {We summarize our results as follows: 1.1. Style is a function of pragmatic variables.2.2. The main pragnatic components are SPEAKER and ADDRESSEE.3.3. Each of these components is characterized by a certain expectancy norm regarding features of stylistic expression. It is true that these features of stylistic characterization often interfere with style features dictated by certain roles which one of the communication partners adopts; nevertheless, they are fundamental for assessing the phenomenon ‘role’.4.4. In recent linguistic approaches to poetic style, it has been the common tendency (implicit or explicit) to regard the general feature of ‘innovation’, among others, as underlying a structural description with generative power. In describing the deviation of poetic forms of expression from everyday language we have not tried to investigate strategies which make this general feature of ‘innovation’ in poetics predictable in any functional sense. Therefore, our question as to those regularities which remain unviolated in modern poetry has necessarily remained unanswered. However, we think that we have devised rules to explain metaphorical phenomena which are more plausible than earlier attempts.5.5. The fact that in explaining style features we speak of the deviant extension of the meaning of lexical items in syntactic sequences, on the one hand, and presupposition, on the other, indicates that we master different levels of competence. The transfers of imagery (psychologically speaking, the obtaining, by one or more semantic features of a lexical item, of priority over the rest of the features and its (their) relation to a different object, which under this transfer receives the phonological representation of the original object name: for example, [function: stand] for the human leg as well as for the leg of a table), furthermore that intersecting of semantic features which deviates from everyday language (for example, lila rede cf. p. 136f.) are principle strategies within stylistic competence indicative first of our commanding over feature complexes which are NORMAL relative to the respective idiosyncratic competence, and second that, beyond that, we also utilize a great number of accepted associations of stylistic features.6.6. Acceptability is a fundamental factor in the interpretation of dynamic competence, which, beyond the basic grammatical competence, is responsible for the strategies of stylistic classification. In other words, beyond a certain (more or less invariant) basic competence, we master a number of strategies which, being functions of pragmatic variables, make possible the identification of different styles. Such strategies are not to be explained on the basis of those formal and substantive predispositions assumed by generative transformational grammar (Katz, 1966). They are only to be explained as processes of structuring constantly being revised in accordance with the ever changing and widening human level of experience.},

	abstract = {The work here offered to the public consists of papers written at different times, but taking their rise from the following occasion. About eighteen years ago I was informed that the Rev. Mr. Gay asserted the possibility of deducing all our intellectual pleasures and pains from association. This put me upon considering the power of association. Mr. Gay published his sentiments on this matter, about the same time, in a dissertation on the Fundamental Principle of Virtue, prefixed to Mr. Archdeacon Law's translation of Archbishop King's Origin of Evil. From inquiring into the power of association I was led to examine both its consequences, in respect of morality and religion, and its physical cause. By degrees many dispositions foreign to the doctrine of association, or or at least, not immediately connected with it, intermixed themselves. I have here put together all my separate papers on these subjects, digesting them in such order as they seemed naturally to suggest, and adding such things as were necessary to make the whole appear more complete and systematical. It has long been the opinion of all the admirer's of Dr. David Hartley among my acquaintance, as well as my own, that is Observations on Man could not have failed to have been more generally read and his theory of the human mind to have prevailed, if it had been made more intelligible; and if the work had not been clogged with a whole system of moral and religious knowledge; which, however excellent, is, in a great measure, foreign to it. Both these obstacles it is my object in this publication to remove; by exhibiting his theory of the human mind, as far as it relates to the doctrine of association of ideas.

While noting connections to formal results in computational linguistics, our focus is on how SP could be implemented in a way that is both linguistically well-grounded and psychologically feasible. We concentrate on incremental learning (with no memory for past inputs), which is now widely assumed in psycholinguistics. However, in investigating its interactions with SP, we uncover the rather startling fact that incremental learning and SP are incompatible, given other standard assumptions. We set out some ideas for ways in which they might be reconciled. Some seem more promising than others, but all appear to carry severe costs in terms of computational load, learning speed or memory resources. The penalty for disobeying SP has long been understood. In future language acquisition research it will be important to address the costs of obeying SP.},

	abstract = {The classification of polarity items along semantic lines, in terms of their licensing environments, has been a topic of debate for the last 30 years or so. The first proposal along these lines was advanced by Frans Zwarts in 1981, in a paper in Dutch, called Negatief Polaire Uitdrukkingen I. In that paper he proposed a binary distinction between weak and strong items, the weak items being licit in all downwardentailing contexts, the strong ones in a proper subset thereof, the set of contexts determined by what he called anti-additive functions. Zwarts’ paper was inspired by the dissertation of Bill Ladusaw, which appeared a year before (Ladusaw 1979). Ladusaw had introduced the notion of downward entailment as the key to generalizing over all contexts in which polarity items like any and ever show up. However, Zwarts noted that some other polarity items, like the Dutch focus adverbial string ook maar ‘so much as’, did not seem to be possible in all of the contexts listed by Ladusaw. In particular, negated universals, like not every, and weakly negative quantifiers like few and seldom, did not appear to license ook maar. By combining the theory of generalized quantifiers, developed by Barwise and Cooper, and the observations regarding ook maar, Zwarts found a notion, antiadditivity, which sets apart the stricter negative elements like n-words, from their weaker relatives like few and negated universals. In later work the binary classification was extended, to a ternary division of weak, strong and superstrong items, in Van der Wouden (1994), and Zwarts (1998). If we add the notion of nonveridicality (proposed in Zwarts 1995, and Giannakidou 1997, 1998, 2011 and elsewhere) and the related one of superweak polarity items, we may even end up with a four-level classification, which I will call the extended Zwarts’ hierarchy, although I don’t want to suggest that anyone has proposed it in exactly this form. I like to consider it nonetheless for},

First,these PPIs are disallowed in the same environments that license yet-type NPIs; second,adding any NPI-licenser rescues the illegitimate constellation. This leads to theconclusion that these PPIs have the combined properties of yet-type and ever-type NPIs:what appears to be a prohibition is nothing but `halfway licensing'. The paper goes on topropose a unification of the analyses of rescuable PPIs, NPIs, and negative concord, andquestions the grounding of polarity sensitivity in the scalar or the referential semantics ofthe items involved.},

Contrary to some claims regarding the potential for nonnative processing, the present data suggest that L1 and L2 speakers show similar ERP responses when processing agreement, even when the L1 lacks the relevant distinction.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the prediction of syntactic structure during sentence processing, using constructions that temporarily allow a sluicing interpretation in English. Making use of two well-known properties of sluicing and pronoun interpretation—connectivity effects and the local antecedent requirement on reflexives, respectively—we show that (1) the parser chooses a sluicing structure over other possible structures when sluicing is a possibility, and (2) the structure which the parser posits for sluicing involves detailed hierarchical syntactic structure. A self-paced reading experiment and three offline experiments (two acceptability rating studies and a sentence completion study) find evidence that readers immediately try to associate a reflexive pronoun embedded inside a wh-phrase with a potential antecedent in the preceding clause. However, this association is made only if a sluicing structure is a possible continuation of the sentence. This finding suggests that readers actively anticipated a sluicing structure when it was grammatically permissible, and that this structure is sufficiently detailed to license reflexive binding. This result adds to the increasing evidence that comprehenders make detailed predictions regarding upcoming linguistic structure.},

Data from Italian, and other languages allowing Pseudo-Relatives, support this hypothesis. Pseudo-Relative availability, however, covaries with the semantics of the main predicate (e.g., perceptual vs. stative). Experiment 1 assesses whether this predicate distinction alone can account for prior attachment results by testing it with a language that disallows Pseudo-Relatives (i.e. English). Low Attachment was found independent of Predicate-Type. Predicate-Type did however have a minor modulatory role. Experiment 2 shows that English, traditionally classified as a Low Attachment language, can demonstrate High Attachment with sentences globally ambiguous between a Small-Clause and a reduced Relative-Clause interpretation. These results support a grammatical account of previous effects and provide novel evidence for the parser’s preference of a Small-Clause over a Restrictive interpretation, crosslinguistically.},

The present article adds to this general program, testing Rothman's (Second Language Research: forthcoming) model for L3 initial state transfer, which when relevant in light of specific language pairings, maintains that typological proximity between the languages is the most deterministic variable determining the selection of syntactic transfer. Herein, I present empirical evidence from the later part of the beginning stages of L3 Brazilian Portuguese (BP) by native speakers of English and Spanish, who have attained an advanced level of proficiency in either English or Spanish as an L2. Examining the related domains of syntactic word order and relative clause attachment preference in L3 BP, the data clearly indicate that Spanish is transferred for both experimental groups irrespective of whether it was the L1 or L2. These results are expected by Rothman's (Second Language Research: forthcoming) model, but not necessarily predicted by other current hypotheses of multilingual syntactic transfer; the implications of this are discussed.},

Such constructions hold even greater interest for the question of the relation between grammatical knowledge and real-time language processing. This article presents results from two experiments on parasitic-gap constructions in English in which the parasitic gap appears inside a subject island, before the licensing gap. An off-line study confirms that parasitic gaps are acceptable when they occur inside the infinitival complement of a subject NP, but not when they occur inside a finite relative clause. An on-line self-paced reading study using a plausibility manipulation technique shows that incremental positing of gaps inside islands occurs in just those environments where parasitic gaps are acceptable. The fact that parasitic gaps are constructed incrementally in language processing presents a challenge for attempts to explain subject islands as epiphenomena of constraints on language processing and also helps to resolve apparent conflicts in previous studies of the role of island constraints in parsing.},

We employ two offline acceptability rating experiments and a sentence fragment completion experiment to investigate to what extent the distribution of Gapping is controlled by grammatical and extra-grammatical constraints. Furthermore, an eye-tracking while reading experiment demonstrated that the parser inserts an ellipsis site incrementally but only when grammatical and extra-grammatical constraints allow for the insertion of the ellipsis site. This study shows that incremental building of the Gapping structure follows from the parser’s general preference to keep the structure of the two conjuncts maximally parallel in a coordination structure as well as from grammatical restrictions on the distribution of Gapping such as the Coordination Constraint.},

Experiment 1 also shows that there is no such difficulty at the subject NP, suggesting that the subject semantic role is not associated with the WH-phrase in the same way as the object role.

	abstract = {This article presents three studies that investigate when syntactic constraints become available during the processing of long-distance backwards pronominal dependencies (backwards anaphora or cataphora). Earlier work demonstrated that in such structures the parser initiates an active search for an antecedent for a pronoun, leading to gender mismatch effects in cases where a noun phrase in a potential antecedent position mismatches the gender of the pronoun [Van Gompel, R. P. G. \& Liversedge, S. P. (2003). The influence of morphological information on cataphoric pronoun assignment. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 29, 128–139]. Results from three self-paced reading studies suggest that structural constraints on coreference, in particular Principle C of the Binding Theory [Chomsky, N. (1981). Lectures on government and binding. Dordrecht, Foris], exert an influence at an early stage of this search process, such that gender mismatch effects are elicited at grammatically licit antecedent positions, but not at grammatically illicit antecedent positions. The results also show that the distribution of gender mismatch effects is unlikely to be due to differences in the predictability of different potential antecedents. These findings suggest that backwards anaphora dependencies are processed with a grammatically constrained active search mechanism, similar to the mechanism used to process another type of long-distance dependency, the wh dependency (e.g., [Stowe, L. (1986). Evidence for online gap creation. Language and Cognitive Processes, 1, 227–245; Traxler, M. J., \& Pickering, M. J. (1996). Plausibility and the processing of unbounded dependencies: an eye-tracking study. Journal of Memory and Language, 35, 454–475.]). We suggest that the temporal priority for syntactic information observed here reflects the predictability of structural information, rather than the need for an architectural constraint that delays the use of non-syntactic information.},

Specifically, it is about the nature of the representation of a Muscovite soldier as an Alien, an Other, moreover, culturally and civilizationally on a lower scale. Such representations are particularly striking in the prose of Hryhoriy Kvitka-Osnovyanenko, in particular in the popular play “The Soldier’s Portrait”. Ivan Kotlyarevsky’s play “Natalka Poltavka” is considered as an example of the dramatist’s direct polemics with Russian authors who rewrite their national history in accordance with imperial matrices. After Shevchenko’s fearless reckoning with the past, the era of dual loyalty, willingness to build one’s state together with one’s conquerers and in accordance with their projects (such a version is proposed in Kotlyarevsky’s “Aeneid”) is left in the past. Romanticism focused on a search for new models of cultural memory and national identity.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate the role of the head-initial/head-final parameter in adult second language (L2) acquisition of English. Sixty Chinese speaking adults were tested in their elicited production of complex sentences which involved pre-and postposed adverbial subordinate clauses both with and without pronoun anaphors. Results obtained in this study match those reported earlier for Japanese speakers learning English (Flynn, 1981; 1983a; 1983b; 1984; in press). Both Japanese and Chinese are head-final languages (Kuno, 1973; Huang, 1982). Findings are used to argue for the role of the head-initial/head-final parameter in adult L2 acquisition of pronoun anaphora. They are also used to argue for a model of grammar in which parameters associated with head-direction are differentiated from parameters associated with word order (Travis, 1983; 1984). Results also provide additional empirical support for the parameter setting model of L2 acquisition currently proposed by Flynn (1983a; 1983b, in press; forthcoming).},

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

A number of equivalent descriptions of finite state languages are explored. A simple structural characterization theorem for finite state languages is established, based on the cyclical structure of the grammar. It is shown that the complement of any finite state language formed on a given vocabulary of symbols is also a finite state language, and that the union of any two finite state languages formed on a given vocabulary is a finite state language; i.e., the set of all finite state languages that can be formed on a given vocabulary is a Boolean algebra.

The characteristics of the phenomenon are nevertheless not uniform across the dialects – three descriptive variables can be discerned: (i) whether or not V2 is required, (ii) whether or not V2 is optional alongside non-V2, and (iii) whether or not non-V2 is allowed with shortwh-elements only. In addition these variables are relative to a 77;subjecthood distinction on thewh-constituent. The phenomenon has received considerable attention by both dialectologists and theoretical syntacticians, and the main purpose of this paper is to systematize the information available in previous works. On the basis of the resulting overview a microparametric account of the variation will be proposed whereby the variation hinges on three microparameters: (i) whether or not interrogative C must be lexicalized, (ii) whether or not shortwh-elements are heads that may lexicalize C, and (iii) whether or not the elementsomthat appears in subjectwh-questions is a head or not. Diachronic speculations concerning the development of the variation will also be raised.},

In Experiments 1 and 3 picture naming and bilingual translation were slower in the categorized than randomized conditions. In Experiment 2 this category interference effect in picture naming was eliminated when picture naming alternated with word naming. Taken together, the results of the three experiments suggest that in both picture naming and bilingual translation a conceptual representation of the word or picture is used to retrieve a lexical entry in one of the speaker′s languages. When conceptual activity is sufficiently great to activate a multiple set of corresponding lexical representations, interference is produced in the process of retrieving a single best lexical candidate as the name or translation. The results of Experiment 3 showed further that category interference in bilingual translation occurred only when translation was performed from the first language to the second language, suggesting that the two directions of translation engage different interlanguage connections. A model to account for the asymmetric mappings of words to concepts in bilingual memory is described.},

Using a fundamental unit of representation, three orthographic systems (i.e., alphabet, syllabary, and logography) can be categorized into two types: morphography and phonography. Previous L1 reading research has suggested that different strategies are used for phonological recoding by morphographic and phonographic readers. This study tested the possibility that these L1 recoding strategies are transferred and utilized in L2 reading. A cross-linguistic experiment involving adult L2 learners of English with contrasting L1 orthographic backgrounds (Arabic, Japanese, Spanish, and English—for native control) was conducted. The results indicate that reading among phonographic readers (Arabic, Spanish, and English) is seriously impaired when essential phonological information is inaccessible. Similar phonological inaccessibility, in contrast, apparently does not affect the reading performance of Japanese, or morphographic, readers. Further, the study demonstrated, first, that phonological inaccessibility exerts differential effects on the reading processes of phonographic and morphographic readers and, second, that L2 readers from different L1 orthographic backgrounds utilize their L1 strategies in reading English as an L2. Hence, the findings of the study verify cognitive strategy transfer during L2 reading.},

	abstract = {To what extent, if any, does Universal Grammar (UG) constrain second language (L2) acquisition? This is not only an empirical question, but one which is currently investigable. In this context, L2 acquisition is emerging as an important new domain of psycholinguistic research. Three logical possibilities have been articulated regarding the role of UG in L2 acquisition: The first is the “no access” hypothesis that claims that no aspect of UG is available to the L2 learner. The second is the “partial access” hypothesis that claims that only LI instantiated principles and LI instantiated parameter-values of UG are available to the learner. The third, called the “full access” hypothesis, asserts that UG in its entirety constrains L2 acquisition.In this paper we argue that there is no compelling evidence to support either of the first two hypotheses. Moreover, we provide evidence concerning functional categories in L2 acquisition consistent with the claim that UG is fully available to the L2 learner (see also Flynn 1987; Li 1993; Martohardjono 1992; Schwartz \& Sprouse 1991; Thomas 1991; White 1989). In addition, we will attempt to clarify some of currently unclear theoretical issues that arise with respect to positing UG as an explanatory theory of L2 acquisition. We will also investigate in some detail certain crucial methodological questions involved in experimentally testing the role of UG in L2 acquisition and finally, we will present a set of experimental results of our own supporting the “Full Access” hypothesis.},

Type frequency is taken to reflect the lexicon, token frequency language use. Type and token frequencies were compared for a total of 10 basic distinctions at the phonological, morphological, lexical and lexico-syntactic levels in English. These include consonants vs. vowels, prefixes vs. suffixes, count vs. mass nouns and transitive vs. intransitive verbs. The empirical analysis reveals that type frequencies may be more, or less, extreme than token frequencies. Non-phonological distinctions evince a higher discrepancy between type and token frequency than phonological ones. In addition, complexity is more strongly discouraged in token than in type frequency, suggesting that it is more of an issue in processing than in storage.

English does not morphologically distinguish different kinds of definites but some languages do (e.g., Fering) (Schwarz, 2013). Korean, an article-less language, differentiates between the two types of definites by marking only one type (i.e., anaphoric) with the demonstrative ku ?that? (Chang, 2009). That is, the English definite article ?the? encodes [+definite, ±anaphoric] and the Korean demonstrative ?ku? encodes [+definite, +anaphoric]. Within the feature reassembly model (Lardiere, 2009), this difference in feature combinations between Korean and English is expected to influence L1-Korean learners? interpretation of English articles.Methodology:An acceptability judgment task was used to assess L1-Korean L2-English learners (22 intermediate and 15 advanced) and 26 English native-speaker controls? comprehension of different types of definites.Data:The intermediate group rated definites significantly higher than indefinites in anaphoric definite contexts but not in non-anaphoric definite contexts, indicating L1 influence. The advanced group rated definites higher than indefinites in non-bridging anaphoric contexts but not in bridging (anaphoric and non-anaphoric) contexts. This suggests that they have re-assembled the features associated with the definite article but have difficulty in accommodating unmentioned propositions for bridging definites.Conclusion:These findings suggest that presupposition accommodation for bridging definites may be another hurdle in article acquisition beyond feature reassembly.Originality/Significance:By focusing on the acquisition of the semantics of definites, exclusively, this study provides new data and information which enable us to come to a more precise and fine-grained understanding of learnability in article acquisition. Thus, the results of the study bring out new and insightful conceptual issues that open up new directions for future research on the acquisition of definiteness.},

We conducted pre-operative functional magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative language mapping in the unique case of a highly proficient quadrilingual with a left frontal brain tumor who acquired her second language at age 5, and her third and fourth languages at 15. We found a predominantly different organization in each language with only a few areas shared by all 4 languages. Contrary to existing evidence, impairment across languages was not related to age of acquisition, amount of exposure, or language similarity. This case suggests that the functional structure of the language system may be highly idiosyncratic in multilingual individuals and supports detailed study in this group to inform neurocognitive models of language.},

	abstract = {This study reports the results obtained through a stride to explore the type and extent of syntactic transfer in the early stages of adult L3 and L4 acquisition. Null-subject parameter (NSP) is a well-known and highly studied syntactic feature in generative studies on third language (L3) acquisition. Following a principles and parameters framework, the underlying principle of language is that languages have pronouns and the parametric variation is that Persian and Italian allow the pronouns to be dropped when in subject position. OV property of embedded clauses has also set itself as the basis of some formal studies on the realm of learning multiple languages. Whereas, the former set the languages with values of [+null-subject] and [-null-subject], the latter creates the language pairings as OV and non-OV languages. The syntactic licensing of null L3 and overt L4 pronominal subjects in declarative main clauses and the OV property in relative clauses were investigated to provide us with new insights on the true architecture of incipient multilingualism and, as such, to clarify the situation of a polyglot. The present instrumental case study was set to challenge the role of transfer during the acquisition of syntax in the initial state of adult L3 and L4. To quantify the cases of correct/incorrect suppliance of the features under investigation, the spontaneous, audio-recorded, productions of a Persian (L1)-speaking learner of L3 Italian and L4 German with advance L2 English proficiency were analyzed using obligatory occasion analysis and target like use analysis formulas. Based on the accuracy percentages generated via the formulas, the L2 status factor was consistently identified to play a significant role in the acquisition of L3 Italian and L4 German initial grammar.},

Experienced teachers of English (N = 20) scored recorded responses from the TOEFL iBT speaking test prior to training and in three sessions following training (100 responses for each session). Scores were analyzed using multifaceted Rasch measurement and traditional measures of rater reliability and agreement, and the frequency with which exemplar responses were viewed was measured. Prior to training, rater severity and internal consistency were already of a standard typical for operational language performance tests, but training resulted in increased inter-rater correlation and agreement as well as improved agreement with established reference scores. Additional experience gained after training appeared to have little further effect on raters’ scoring consistency, although the level of agreement with reference scores continued to increase. The most accurate raters generally reviewed exemplar responses more often and took longer to make scoring decisions compared to the least accurate raters. These results raise questions regarding the relative contribution of scoring aids such as exemplars and scoring rubrics to desirable scoring patterns.},

The CEFR offers potentially relevant general scales and subscales, but also more specific subscales for writing in the academic context. However, recent challenges to traditional views of academic writing have potential implications for assessment frameworks such as the CEFR when they are used to identify readiness for, and progress in, academic study. In this article we explore the views of students on what it means to “do” academic writing. Questionnaires, interviews, and short reflective texts were used to investigate the changing perceptions of first-year undergraduate students at an Australian university. The analysis of student data confirms the reality of the more complex view of academic writing suggested by the recent literature. The article then considers what implications this has for the adequacy of the definitions provided in the CEFR. It suggests that the CEFR descriptors underrepresent the complexity of the challenges of academic writing, particularly its cognitive demands. A new and rather different approach will be required to inform assessments used to manage the admission of students in`to academic writing contexts and the monitoring of their progress.},

The investigation aimed to explore qualitative and quantitative aspects of metaphonological awareness manifested through the participants’ self-repair and modifications of pronunciation mistakes in L3 Polish, reflective metalinguistic analysis of their oral performance in L3, intentional focus on articulatory gestures, self-awareness of problems in L3 pronunciation, the level of metacognitive control, and comments on the pronunciation learning process. Explored from a multilingual perspective, the construct of metaphonological awareness was demonstrated to entail an interaction of metalinguistic awareness as well as cross-linguistic awareness and to be an essential component of multilingual competence.},

Applying Processability Theory as the theoretical framework we claim that second language (L2) learners can only produce forms they are able to process. We thus argue that the first language (L1) influence on the L2 is developmentally moderated. Data were collected from German L2 learners with Swedish as their L1. Twenty informants participated in the study, 10 in their first year of German (13 years of age) and 10 in their second year of German (14 years of age). Both languages involved are typologically very close but not mutually intelligible. The results show that Swedish learners of German do not transfer the verb-second structure from their L1 to the L2 even though this structure is identical in both languages.Instead they start out with canonical word order and subsequently produce an intermediate structure (adv NPsubj V X), which is ungrammatical in the L1 and the L2. These observations support the idea of a developmentally moderated transfer. The results clearly contradict the predictions from the ‘full transfer/full access’ hypothesis (Schwartz and Sprouse, 1994; 1996).},

Raters provided open comments on their marking experiences., Results suggested a significant impact of MM; approximately 30\% and 50\% of candidates in phases 1 and 2 respectively were awarded different (adjacent) CEFR levels depending on the choice of MM used to assign scores. There was a trend of higher CEFR levels with the holistic MM and lower CEFR levels with the part MM. Although strong correlations were found between all pairings of MMs, further analyses revealed important differences. The part MM was shown to display superior measurement qualities particularly in allowing raters to make finer distinctions between different speaking ability levels.

Westergaard’s article is among those that pushes the boundaries of Generative Grammar (GG).

Specifically, the assumption that all learning derives from general cognitive processes—hence, no essential difference between L1, L2, and Ln; the use of cues that are emergent and acquired piecemeal, and the idea that language development proceeds from the specific to the general, are all hallmarks of the UbA.

However, due to complex emission sources and nonlinear chemistry, it is unclear how such a shift might impact air quality. Here we apply a prototype version of the new-generation NOAA GFDL global Atmospheric Model, version 4 (GFDL AM4) to investigate the impact on U.S. air quality from an aggressive conversion of internal combustion vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). We examine a suite of scenarios designed to quantify the effect of both the magnitude of EV market penetration and the source of electricity generation used to power them. We find that summer surface ozone (O3) decreases in most locations due to widespread reductions of traffic NOx emissions. Summer fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases on average and largest in areas with increased coal-fired power generation demands. Winter O3 increases due to reduced loss via traffic NOx while PM2.5 decreases since larger ammonium nitrate reductions offset increases in ammonium sulfate. The largest magnitude changes are simulated at the extremes of the probability distribution. Increasing the fraction of vehicles converted to EVs further decreases summer O3, while increasing the fraction of electricity generated by “emission-free” sources largely eliminates the increases in summer PM2.5 at high EV adoption fractions. Ultimately, the number of conventional vehicles replaced by EVs has a larger effect on O3 than PM2.5, while the source of the electricity for those EVs exhibit greater control on PM2.5.},

	abstract = {The Duolingo English Test (DET) is a computer adaptive test of English proficiency that is increasingly used for English-medium university admissions purposes. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, test centers were shut down in many countries, and major tests including the TOEFL iBT and IELTS could not be administered. The DET is an “at home” test, and thus many universities began accepting DET scores as ameasure of applicants’ English proficiency. Because a revised version of the DET was launched in July, 2019, and because of the large increase in universities accepting DET scores, a critical review of the DET is warranted. The current review lauds the accessibility of the test (e.g., it is an inexpensive “at home” test that can be taken anywhere, in less than an hour, with scores returned in 48 hours). However, the test has multiple shortcomings: the test tasks have little in common with the types of language tasks university students engage in; the test does not assess test takers’ academic language ability, discourse level competence, or interactional competence; it is susceptible to cheating and test preparation; and it has a potential for negative washback on learners and learning systems. In addition, there is a lack of independent research validating the use of DET scores for admissions. Given these shortcomings, the use of DET scores cannot be recommended for university admissions purposes.},

Looking into the future, issues that need to be dealt with include developing a fuller representation of the construct and of more contextually relevant assessments, deciding upon additional assessment criteria and the appropriate interpretation thereof, and determining how technology can be applied in assessment practice and the extent to which technology fundamentally changes the construct itself. These all have implications for testing if it is to be relevant and fit for purpose.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates relations between the meanings of verbs and the syntactic structures in which they appear. This investigation is motivated by the enigmas as to how children discover verb meanings. Well-known problems with unconstrained induction of word meanings from observation of world circumstances suggest that additional constraints or sources of information are required. If there exist strong and reliable parallels between the structural and semantic properties of verbs, then an additional source of information about verb meanings is reliably present in each verb's linguistic context. Five experiments are presented which investigate the following hypothesis regarding the scope of these relations: The closer any two verbs in their semantic structure, the greater the overlap should be in their licensed syntactic structures. To investigate this hypothesis, data of two kinds were collected from different groups of subjects: (a) One group of subjects was asked to judge the semantic relatedness of verbs by selecting the semantic outlier in triads presented to them. (b) A second group of subjects was asked to judge the grammaticality of these same verbs in a large range of syntactic environments. These two types of data were then compared to assess the degree of correspondence in the two partitionings (syntactic and semantic) of the verb set. The findings, overall, support the view that the syntax of verbs is a quite regular, although complex, projection from their semantics. In conclusion, we discuss the kinds of features that are formally marked in syntactic structure and relate these to the problem of verb-vocabulary acquisition in young children.},

The auditory-vocal memory span for digits was used with two highly intelligent undergraduates; the S's were given a complete series of from 5 digits until they broke down, every day. In the course of 52 learning periods one S improved 47\%, while in 57 periods the other improved 36\%. The difference between S's seems to lie in the fact that the former more actively attempted various methods of grouping; when the latter also did this then more improvement resulted in his case likewise. From these results it seems that the grouping process is employed in all memory spans involving more than 5 digits; in the light of the great improvement it would seem doubtful if we are here dealing with an ability whose limits are clearly congenitally fixed.

	abstract = {Recent developments in linguistic theory have led to an important reorientation of research in related fields of linguistic inquiry as well as in linguistics itself. The developments I have in mind, viewed from the point of view of government-binding theory, have to do with the character­ ization of Universal Grammar (UG) as a set of subtheories, each with its set of central principles (perhaps just one principle central to each subtheory) and parameters (perhaps just one for each principle) according to which a principle can vary between an unmarked ('-') and a marked ('+') para­ metric value (Chomsky, 1985; 1986). For example, let us assume that there is an X-bar theory in explanation of those features of phrase structure irreducible to other subtheo­ ries of UG. Within X-bar theory variation among languages is then allowed only with respect to the position the head of a phrase occupies in rela t ion to its complemen ts such that the phrases of a language will be either right- or left-headed. Thus languages will vary between being right-headed in this respect (as in Japanese phrase structure) and being left-headed (as in English phrase structure). Everything else about the phrase structure of particular languages will be fixed within X-bar theory itself or else it will fallout from other subtheories of UG: Case theory; 0-theory, etc. (Chomsky, 1985:161-62; Chomsky, 1986:2-4; and references cited there). Hatters are the same in other modules of grammar.},

At the same time, it is clear that foreign languages are languages. The fundamental difference hypothesis (FDH) was introduced as a way to account for the general characteristics of foreign language learning. The FDH was originally formulated in the context of the theory of rich Universal Grammar, and this theory has guided much foreign language acquisition research over the past two decades. However, advances in the understanding of language have undermined much of the supporting framework.The FDH—indeed all of SLA research—must be rethought in light of these advances. It is proposed here that (a) foreign language grammars make central use of patches, which are also seen as peripheral phenomena in native languages; (b) non-domain-specific processes are used in foreign language acquisition, but that these are also employed—although more effectively because they are integrated into the language system—by native language development; and (c) foreign language online processing relies heavily on the use of shallow parses, but these are also available in native language processing, although less crucially.},

They explore observational tasks for collecting natural speech and experimental tasks for eliciting specific types of speech. Language comprehension tasks are also reviewed so researchers can study participants\&\#8217; interpretations of speech and conceptualizations of grammar. Most tasks are oriented towards children, but special considerations for infants are also reviewed, as well as multilingual children. Chapters also provide strategies for transcribing and coding raw speech data into reliable data sets that can be scientifically analyzed.

As a result, a number of different approaches, both empirically and intuitively based, are open to developers. In this paper we outline the approach taken in the revision of a set of assessment scales used with speaking tests, and present the value of combining methodologies to inform and refine scale development. We set the process in the context of the growing influence of the Common European Framework of Reference (Council of Europe 2001) and outline a number of stages in terms of the procedures followed and outcomes produced. The findings describe a range of data that was collected and analysed through a number of phases and used to inform the revision of the scales, including consultation with experts, and data-driven qualitative and quantitative research studies. The overall aim of the paper is to illustrate the importance of combining intuitive and data-driven scale construction methodologies, and to suggest a usable scale construction model for application or adaptation in a variety of contexts.},

	abstract = {This autobiographical article, which began as an interview, reports some reflections by Lila Gleitman on the development of her thinking and her research—in concert with a host of esteemed collaborators over the years—on issues of language and mind, focusing on how language is acquired. Gleitman entered the field of linguistics as a student of Zellig Harris, and learned firsthand of Noam Chomsky's early work. She chose the psychological perspective, later helping to found the field of cognitive science; and with her husband and long-term collaborator, Henry Gleitman, for over 50 years fostered a continuing research community aimed at answering questions such as: When language input to the child is restricted, what is left to explain language acquisition? The studies reported here find that argument structure encoded in the syntax is key (syntactic bootstrapping) and that children learn word meaning in epiphanies (propose but verify).},

	abstract = {Findings from recent psycholinguistic studies of bilingual processing support the hypothesis that both languages of a bilingual are always active and that bilinguals continually engage in processes of language selection. This view aligns with the convergence hypothesis of bilingual language representation. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that when bilinguals perform a task in one language they need to inhibit their other, nontarget language(s) and that stronger inhibition is required when the task is performed in the weaker language than in the stronger one. The study of multilingual individuals who acquire aphasia resulting from a focal brain lesion offers a unique opportunity to test the convergence hypothesis and the inhibition asymmetry. We report on a trilingual person with chronic nonfluent aphasia who at the time of testing demonstrated greater impairment in her first acquired language (Persian) than in her third, later learned language (English). She received treatment in English followed by treatment in Persian. An examination of her connected language production revealed improvement in her grammatical skills in each language following intervention in that language, but decreased grammatical accuracy in English following treatment in Persian. The increased error rate was evident in structures that are used differently in the two languages (e.g., auxiliary verbs). The results support the prediction that greater inhibition is applied to the stronger language than to the weaker language, regardless of their age of acquisition. We interpret the findings as consistent with convergence theories that posit overlapping neuronal representation and simultaneous activation of multiple languages and with proficiency-dependent asymmetric inhibition in multilinguals.},

An actionbased approach is related to other approaches, such as content-based, project-based and task-based teaching and learning. However, it makes agency, rather than the particular curricular organisation, the defining construct. In this paper, various situated aspects of agency are examined, such as issues of power and control, democracy in the classroom, and the relationships between structure and process. A central aspect of an action-based approach is the centrality of perception, and its intricate connections to action and understanding. Perception is also central in the development of self and identity, in the shaping of the learners' relationships to their world. Finally, pedagogical strategies and actions are illustrated, such as a coherent and non-trivial model of pedagogical scaffolding that integrates structuring and microgenesis.},

The first section discusses diverse approaches to language storage. It introduces a model that considers connections between different levels of language representation, i.e., conceptual and lexical features, morpho-syntactic information, and phonological patterns. The second section is concerned with access to different languages: the focus here is on language production and models of interactive activation. The next section focuses on control mechanisms that are capable of inhibiting one language while the other is spoken. These theoretical assumptions are illustrated by authentic speech production data that provide insights into the cognitive workings of bilingual speakers. Finally, differences in mental representation due to age of acquisition or language proficiency are discussed and explained by dissimilarities in memory types and neural processes of knowledge activation.

We employed an AX discrimination task, testing categorical discrimination of Polish sibilants, and a cross-linguistic similarity task, testing perceptual distance between Polish, English and German vowels. We examined L3 Polish perception in 10 multilinguals (aged 14) with L1 German and L2 English who differed in terms of language status (heritage vs. non-heritage). Their perception tasks performance was analysed for accuracy and reaction time. The cross-linguistic similarity task demonstrated that multilinguals assimilate some L3 sounds to both L1 and L2 categories, with a preference for the latter. In the majority of cases multilinguals make a distinction between similar L1, L2 and L3 sounds. The AX results showed that even beginner L3 learners distinguish highly similar L3 sibilant pairs. Our data suggests that the PAM-L2 model could also be extended to L3 acquisition; however, beginner L3 learners seem more likely to perceive subtle acoustic differences in novel phonological contrasts.},

Spanish, unlike English, is a “pro-drop” language, having the following properties, all thought to be related by the “pro-drop” parameter: (1) missing subjects, (2) free subject-verb inversion, (3) that trace effects. Subjects were asked to make grammaticality judgments on a number of English sentences, including some with “pro-drop” characteristics, which would have been grammatical in Spanish but were ungrammatical in English.

A study was designed to test such claims by investigating the production of English grammatical morphology by 18 adult native speakers of Spanish under three different conditions of exposure to English L2: (1) Instruction Only, (2) Naturalistic, and (3) Mixed (a combination of 1 and 2). Effects of the three conditions of second language exposure were revealed in the types of errors produced during individual conversations with a researcher: (1) All subjects made errors of morpheme oversuppliance in inappropriate contexts and morpheme omission in required contexts; however, the former were more prevalent among Instruction Only subjects, and the latter more common among Naturalistic subjects. These differences were statistically significant. (2) The Naturalistic group tended to omit plural -s endings on nouns which were premodified by quantifiers. This nonredundant marking of plurality, characteristic of many pidgin speakers, was significantly different from the nontarget plural productions of the other two groups. Despite these differences in production errors, statistically high correlations were found among the three groups of subjects with regard to rank order accuracy for grammatical morphology. Results of the study suggest that different conditions of exposure to English L2 do not significantly alter the accuracy order in which grammatical morphemes are produced. However, as reflected in production errors, different conditions appear to affect learners' hypotheses about the target morphology and their strategies for using it.},

A taxonomy of twenty error types was designed to analyze the errors in the Auxiliary (Aux) and Verb Phrase (VP) of the translations. The error types were categorized into errors of overgeneralization, transfer, translation, indeterminate origin, and errors not considered. The results indicated that the errors made by the elementary and intermediate students were not qualitatively different. However, the subjects' reliance on the stategies of overgeneralization and transfer was found to be qualitatively different. The elementary subjects' reliance on the transfer strategy was found to be significantly higher than that of the intermediate subjects; the intermediate subjects' reliance on the overgeneralization stategy was found to be significantly higher than that of the elementary subjects. These findings appear to be consistent with a theory which considers second language acquisition to be an actively creative process dependent upon a student's ability to assimilate and subsume new information into already existing cognitive structures. The overgeneralization and transfer learning strategies appear to be two distinctly different linguistic manifestations of one psychological process: reliance on prior learning to facilitate new learning. The results also tend to confirm the weakness of a transfer-based theory of errors and require an explanation which takes into account not only interference from within the target language inself, but also the learner's cognitive characteristics and his resulting learning strategies.},

Because the language used in the Middle Ages to speculate about UG was an L2 and because philosophers of language appropriated a metalanguage from L2 literature, there was commerce between the activities of L2 teaching and learning and attempts to define UG. Influence also flowed from work addressing the nature of language into L2 pedagogy. In the 20th century, much L2 research has adopted the tools and goals of generative linguistics, but few of the fruits of such work have been incorporated back into linguistic theory. Thus the different contexts of the medieval and modern eras have shaped in different ways how UG has been investigated and how L2s have been studied.},

The main goals were to explore treatment effects, possible cross-linguistic transfer effects and to investigate possible inhibition of the untreated languages.Methods \& Procedures: The participants were one trilingual speaker (Portuguese-Ronga-Norwegian) with nonfluent aphasia and one bilingual speaker (English-Norwegian) with fluent aphasia. They received two types of treatment: communication-based therapy and Semantic Feature Analysis. Treatment was conducted in Norwegian, a late-acquired language for both speakers. Treatment effects were measured in action naming tasks and narrative tasks in the treated language as well as the untreated languages.Outcomes \& Results: Overall, the participants responded positively to the verb production treatments. This was demonstrated at the lexical level and also in discourse production, especially in the treated, but also in the untreated languages. No inhibition of the untreated languages was found.Conclusions: The data provide evidence for positive effects of verb-retrieval treatment provided in sentence contexts in a late-learned weaker language of multilingual speakers with aphasia. The treatments did not lead to an unwanted inhibition of the untreated language, which is an important finding for clinicians as well as for researchers. The results provide evidence for a shared conceptual network of the languages in bilingual speakers, supporting current models of bilingual language processing.},

The study reveals links between self-assessment, autonomy and identity, documenting how the learner utilized her bilingualism as an important resource in learning Spanish, shifted between languages and cultures and employed a variety of self-assessment techniques. The findings of the study suggest that immersion in a new language could make a powerful impact on how bilingual immigrant learners self-interpret themselves in their first and second language.

This raises the question of which uniform meaning for and could account for the apparent dichotomy.

We examine the domain of negative quantifiers nobody/nothing and negative polarity items anybody/anything by Catalan-Spanish early bilinguals learning English as the L3 in adulthood. We offer two group analyses. The first is the superset of low beginner proficiency speakers (all participants taking part in a specially designed English course) and then a subset group (only those who were true ab initio L3 learners—that is, with no previous study of English). The analyses combine to show that exposure matters beyond proficiency—even when proficiency is held constant at very low levels, low proficiency L3 learners who have had some instruction/exposure to an L3 pattern differently from truly ab initio L3 learners. We discuss how this reality complicates isolating L3 transfer proper from effects of L3 development/acquisition and thus, by extension, to all cases of transfer such as adult and child L2.},

Six IELTS examiners assessed 36 test-takers’ performances under the live, audio, and video rating conditions. Scores in the three rating modes were calibrated using the many-facet Rasch model (MFRM). For all three modes, examiners provided written justifications for their ratings, and verbal reports were also collected to gain insights into examiner perceptions towards performance under the audio and video conditions. Results showed that, for all rating criteria, audio ratings were significantly lower than live and video ratings. Examiners noticed more negative performance features under the two non-live rating conditions, compared to the live condition. However, richer information about test-taker performance in the video mode appeared to cause raters to rely less on such negative evidence than audio raters when awarding scores. Verbal report data showed that having visual information in the video-rating mode helped examiners to understand what the test-takers were saying, to comprehend better what test-takers were communicating using non-verbal means, and to understand with greater confidence the source of test-takers’ hesitation, pauses, and awkwardness.},

Throughout the explication of this pragmatic account, a series of insights are offered to help readers reexamine their contexts of teaching and pedagogical practices. It is suggested that for idiom instruction to achieve social immediacy, that is, attain communicative reality and social relevance in everyday discourse, the conditions for optimal idiom learning need to be made compatible with and supportive of the way English language learners learn best. The author concludes with implications for practicing and testing idiomatic competence across the curriculum, even at the tertiary level, in a supportive environment that values active, real-life participation and engagement in English language learning both inside and outside the language class.},

The results of acceptability judgement tests and preference tests show that the initial state of L3 English is influenced exclusively by the final state of L1 Arabic.

Language mixing found in multilingual speakers with aphasia has been suggested to reflect deficits associated with the brain lesion. In this paper, we examine language mixing behaviour in multilingual people with aphasia to test the hypothesis that the use of language mixing reflects a communicative strategy. We analysed connected language production elicited from 11 individuals with aphasia. Words produced were coded as mixed or not. Frequencies of mixing were tabulated for each individual in each of her or his languages in each of two elicitation tasks (Picture sequence description, Narrative production). We tested the predictions that there would be more word mixing: for participants with greater aphasia severity; while speaking in a language of lower post-stroke proficiency; during a task that requires more restricted word retrieval; for people with non-fluent aphasia, while attempting to produce function words (compared to content words); and that there would be little use of a language not known to the interlocutors. The results supported three of the five predictions. We interpret our data to suggest that multilingual speakers with aphasia mix words in connected language production primarily to bypass instances of word-retrieval difficulties, and typically avoid pragmatically inappropriate language mixing.},

Aims: We set out to examine cross‐language generalisation of language treatment in a trilingual speaker with mild chronic aphasia. Methods \& Procedures: Language treatment was administered in English, the participant's second language (L2). The first treatment block focused on morphosyntactic skills and the second on language production rate.

Speech rate also improved in English (L2) and French (L3) following that treatment block. No changes were observed in Hebrew, the participant's L1.

In addition, (4) the putative “more plausible interpretation” they propose is not theoretically viable, is based on false assumptions regarding the empirical facts of language processing, and is inconsistent with precise analyses of the data that it is attempting to explain.

	abstract = {There is an emerging awareness in the field of L2 acquisition regarding the contributions made by both Contrastive Analysis (CA) and Creative Construction (CC) theories of L2 acquisition. CA theories indicate that the L1 experience is important in L2 acquisition, and CC theories indicate that principles of acquisition independent of this experience are also integral to L2 learning. Reconciliation of these two aspects within a principled, empirically-based theory of L2 acquisition has been difficult (cf. Eckman 1977, 1984; Zobl 1980; Andersen 1983, 1984; Gundel and Tarone 1983; Liceras 1983; Rutherford 1983, 1984; White 1985). This paper argues that the parameter-setting model of Universal Grammar (UG) (proposed by Flynn 1983a, b, 1987) for L2 acquisition provides the scaffolding necessary for an integration of these two components within one explanatory account. Consistent with CC, L2 learners within this model use principles of UG isolated in L1 acquisition in the construction of the L2 grammar; however, when values of parameters associated with these principles differ between the L1 and the L2, learners assign a new value to cohere with the values for the new target language. The L1 experience counts in determining whether such a new assignment of a parametric value is necessary. This aspect of the model is consistent with a traditional CA theory of L2 learning. Empirical support for this model is provided by a study that investigates the role of the head-initial/head-final parameter (Stowell 1981) in adult L2 acquisition of pronoun anaphora. Two groups of adults — L1 speakers of Spanish, a head-initial language and L1 speakers of Japanese, a head-final language — were studied in their elicited production of English, a head-initial language. Results indicate that both groups of learners use the head-initial/head-final parameter as a source of structural organization for the L2. Results also indicate that Japanese speakers (L1 ≠ L2) are sensitive, from early stages of acquisition, to the mismatch in head-direction in English and Japanese, and that they assign new values to this parameter to cohere with the target L2 value. These speakers are thus argued to have the head-initial/head-final parameter set in two different ways. Parameters of acquisition in the two cases correspond to those isolated for L1 acquisition of English; however, the point at which this similarity is observed depends upon the degree of correspondence between the two languages.},

In addition, data were collected on several predictors of individual differences in linguistic attainment, including some related to language experience (print exposure, education, and—for L2 speakers—length of residence and use of English) and some relating to an individual's aptitude to learn (language analytic ability and nonverbal intelligence) as well as age and (for L2 speakers) age of arrival. As anticipated, the native group outperformed L2 speakers on all three language measures, although the effect sizes were much larger for collocations than for grammar or vocabulary. Crucially, there were vast individual differences in both groups and considerable overlap between groups, particularly for grammar. Regression analyses revealed both similarities and differences between native and nonnative speakers in which nonlinguistic measures best predict performance on the language tasks.},

This chapter draws the background to generative linguistics and shows how Chomsky's real philosophical achievement in this area was to pose an explanatory question that had previously been neglected. Generative grammar as a research field was initiated by Chomsky in the 1950s. Chomsky's cognitive turn was revolutionary, not least because it went against the philosophical grain vis-a-vis the role of formalism or logical analysis. P. Strawson had suggested that there is a Homeric struggle between those who favor a formal approach to natural language and those who favor a communicationintention approach. For Chomsky, the proper role of formalism in the realm of natural language is the framing of structural constraints on the consumption and production of language, both of which are cognitive capacities.},

The growth of language in the individual, it is suggested, depends on (i) genetic factors, (ii) experience, and (iii) principles that are not specific to the faculty of language. The best current explanation of how language is recursively generated is through Merge, an operation that takes objects already constructed, and reconstructs a new object from them, generating a ‘language of thought’, perhaps in a manner close to optimal (relying on principles of category (iii)), with externalization (hence communication) a secondary process. The concluding section of the article offers several objectives for future research in the field.},

I argue that this new conception of freedom in The Human Condition draws its strength from a philosophical and rhetorical transformation of the question of the definition of man in theology and the natural sciences. I follow the lead of scholars who highlight Arendt's relation to Heidegger and Augustine, but my method of close reading—I offer the first examination of each appearance of the term “natality” in The Human Condition—leads me to show how Arendt's engagement with philosophical anthropologist Arnold Gehlen opens the space for alternative conceptions of freedom. The figurative and corporeal insistence of her writing, enacted in an embrace of the materiality of language, not only indicates liberation from the strictures of the empirical (as one expects from a philosophical concept) but also demonstrates ways in which the unexpected can arise both in this sphere of freedom and as a fundamental shift of this sphere.},

In this contribution we consider whether there is such a thing as a true monolingual, and if there is a difference between dialects, styles, registers and languages. While linguistic and psycholinguistic studies suggest differences in the processing of a third, compared to the first or second language, neurolinguistic research has shown that generally the same areas of the brain are activated during language use in proficient multilinguals. It is concluded that while from traditional linguistic and psycholinguistic perspectives there are grounds to differentiate monolingual, bilingual and multilingual processing, a more dynamic perspective on language processing in which development over time is the core issue, leads to a questioning of the notion of languages as separate entities in the brain.},

In this article we present data from a longitudinal corpus of letters written by a speaker of North American Icelandic over a span of seventy-two years. The earliest letters suggest that the writer acquired Icelandic consistent with the baseline. However, in the last thirty years of writing, non-target forms emerge in the corpus. Morphosyntax, notably grammatical gender and inflectional morphology, is the most affected domain of grammar. In this article we focus on the nature of the changes attested for grammatical gender across time. Our results show that gender assignment does not undergo a systematic re-analysis. However, the non-target gender agreement indicates the overuse of an agreement default, which may reflect a trend towards a systematic reduction of the gender agreement system.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-881585-3},
	abstract = {This chapter considers the extent to which it is still meaningful to conceptualize pro-drop phenomena in parametric terms, introducing a three-factors model in which parameters are emergent, not UG-given. Within this model, it seems possible to distinguish macro, meso, and micro pro-drop systems. The attested systematic variation in even the most familiar instantiations of these putative types, however, raises questions about existing parametric accounts of the acquisition and typological relationship between these systems. Drawing on parallels with a neo-emergentist account of word-order variation, the chapter argues for an approach assuming interdependent parameters (a parameter-hierarchy) where the ‘size’ and precise formal specification of pro-drop in individual grammars is determined by the way the model’s three factors interact, with different formal features playing potentially parallel roles in different systems. The typological picture is thus more variation-rich than previously assumed, but this variation exhibits the kind of cross-linguistic systematicity a parametric approach predicts.},

	abstract = {This volume is dedicated to the concept and several applications of Dominant Language Constellations (DLC), by which it advances understanding of current multilingualism through addition of a novel perspective from which to view contemporary language use and acquisition. The term Dominant Language Constellation denotes the set of a person’s or group's most expedient languages, functioning as an entire unit and enabling an individual or group to meet their needs in a multilingual environment. The volume presents pioneering contributions that employ DLC as the lens for analysing a wide array of issues. These include multilingual syntactic development, cross-linguistic interaction and multilingual production in formal and informal educational contexts, as well as linguistic profiles of multilingual groups used in elementary school and higher education. Other DLC issues include discussions of how identity, emotions and attitudes operate in various minority and majority contexts. Because the DLC concept does not assume any inherent hierarchy of languages it can serve as a framework public policy in multilingual countries/communities faced with challenging policy determinations regarding choice of languages for use in education settings and more widely in social institutions and the economy. Some chapters develop and extend the DLC concept, others adapt and apply it to a variety of contexts, both global and local. Many chapters feature educational and social settings across large parts of the world– Africa, Australia, Europe, North America (Canada and the USA) and Southeast Asia. The volume can serve as supplementary reading for courses on multilingualism, sociolinguistics, language policy and planning, educational linguistics, Second and Third Language Acquisition.},

These studies help us better understand language acquisition, and most particularly the nature of the hypotheses language learners impose when learning a new target language. Language development studies focusing on the acquisition of relative clauses in English presented in this chapter seek to elucidate language development by contemplating the development of language-specific properties of the complementizer phrase (CP). The chapter introduces three influential current models of multilingual acquisition: the second-language (L2) status factor; the typological primacy model; and the cumulative enhancement model (CEM) for language acquisition. L1 acquisition studies have provided important insights into how the mind and language work. The chapter also explores L3 acquisition, the acquisition process of any multilingual learner whether of a third language or a fourth language.},

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the 21st century, integration and citizenship discourses and policies have become more and more intertwined in contemporary superdiverse societies in Western Europe. Flanders (Belgium) is a clear example of how integration is gradually being replaced by virtual or moral citizenship. The concept of citizenship is used in multiple ways: citizenship as nationality, but also citizenship as a set of norms and values (which immigrants particularly have to comply with) and citizenship as identification with the host society. The authors argue that the “integration policy” in Flanders is in fact a hidden “citizenship policy” that includes the old, obsolete, and static concepts and definitions of monolingualism, nationality, and ethnicity. In these renewed integration policies, proficiency in the dominant language and knowledge of the host society are seen as conditions for social participation, therefore new immigrants have to take a compulsory integration course and “older” migrants are made to enroll in Dutch language courses. Increasingly, standardized tests—and especially language tests—are used to determine the learning outcomes of these courses and to regulate possibilities of social and economic participation. The authors advocate looking at citizenship and the use of plurilingual repertoires in the city as dynamic and contextualized processes, shaped in daily practice through negotiation in social networks. In a context where “superdiversity” is becoming the norm, it is important to reflect on the boundaries of the current recipes—integration policies including obligatory language tests—that are being used to promote and strengthen social and civic activity.},

We discuss the predictions and functional significance of the PPH for adult SLA and multilingualism studies, detailing a methodology that examines the effects of acquiring Brazilian Portuguese on the Spanish phonological systems learned before and after the so-called critical period (i.e., comparing simultaneous versus successive adult English-Spanish bilinguals learning Brazilian Portuguese as an L3).},

	abstract = {The incidence of nativelikeness in adult second language acquisition is a controversial issue in SLA research. Although some researchers claim that any learner, regardless of age of acquisition, can attain nativelike levels of second language (L2) proficiency, others hold that attainment of nativelike proficiency is, in principle, impossible. The discussion has traditionally been framed within the paradigm of a critical period for language acquisition and guided by the question of whether SLA is constrained by the maturation of the brain. The work presented in this article can be positioned among those studies that have focused exclusively on the apparent counterexamples to the critical period. We report on a large-scale study of Spanish/Swedish bilinguals (n = 195) with differing ages of onset of acquisition ({\textless}1–47 years), all of whom identify themselves as potentially nativelike in their L2. Listening sessions with native-speaker judges showed that only a small minority of those bilinguals who had started their L2 acquisition after age 12, but a majority of those with an age of onset below this age, were actually perceived as native speakers of Swedish. However, when a subset (n = 41) of those participants who did pass for native speakers was scrutinized in linguistic detail with a battery of 10 highly complex, cognitively demanding tasks and detailed measurements of linguistic performance, representation, and processing, none of the late learners performed within the native-speaker range; in fact, the results revealed also that only a few of the early learners exhibited actual nativelike competence and behavior on all measures of L2 proficiency that were employed. Our primary interpretation of the results is that nativelike ultimate attainment of a second language is, in principle, never attained by adult learners and, furthermore, is much less common among child learners than has previously been assumed.},

	abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of dis­parities up to about the width of the mask’s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2½-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum’s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process.},

	abstract = {This paper explores differences between Connectionist proposals for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a ‘language of thought’: i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the ‘systematicity’ of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or ‘abstract neurological’) structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.
Résumé
Cet articleétudie les différences entre modèles connectionistes et modèles classiques de la structure cognitive. Nous pensons que, bien que les deux types de modèles stipulent l'existence d'états mentaux représentationnels, la différence essentielle est que seuls les modèles classiques requièrent l'existence d'un niveau de représentation symbolique—un “langage de la pensée”—, c'est-à-dire d'états représentationnels possédant une structure syntaxique et sémantique. Nous examinons ensuite différents arguments qui militent en faveur de l'existence de représentations mentales ayant ces propriétés. Certains de ces arguments reposent sur la “systématicité” des représentations mentales, c'est-à-dire sur le fait que les capacités cognitives exhibent toujours certaines symétries, de sorte que la capacitéd'entretenir certaines pensées implique la capacitéd'entretenir d'autres pensées apparentées par leur contenu sémantique. Nous pensons que ces arguments montrent de manière convainquante que l'architecture de l'esprit/du cerveau n'est pas connectioniste au niveau cognitif. Nous nous demandons ensuite s'il est possible d'interpréter le connectionisme comme une analyse des structures neuronales (ou des structures neurologiques “abstraites”) dans lesquelles est réalisée l'architecture cognitive classique. Nous examinons plusieurs des arguments avancés habituellement en défense du connectionisme, et en concluons que ceux-ci n'ont de sens que dans cette interprétation.},

In 1986, I argued that vocabulary was about to acquire a legitimate and prominent place within applied linguistics (Laufer 1986), but I did not envisage the vast quantities of lexical research that would have been produced in the following two decades. One of the central concerns of vocabulary researchers is the source of L2 vocabulary learning. Is it L2 input, enhanced input, interaction, communicative tasks, non-communicative ‘artificial’ exercises, list learning, or repetition? A similar question is addressed by SLA researchers in general. This similarity of interests, which demonstrates the integration of vocabulary into mainstream SLA, prompted me to define the topic of this timeline as I did. And since the field of SLA developed in the 1980s, this timeline starts in the nineteen-eighties. I focus here on the external sources of learning, i.e. language input and instructional techniques, and not on learner-related variables, like motivation, L1, age, or strategies of learning. Nor do I focus on any other areas of lexical research, important as they may be, such as the construct of vocabulary knowledge, lexical development, testing, bilingual mental lexicon, or corpora analyses.},

The book defends and extends the groundbreaking idea that thinking is couched in a symbolic system realized in the brain. This idea is central to the representational theory of mind which has been established as a key reference point in modern philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. The foundation stone of our present cognitive science is Turing's suggestion that cognitive processes are not associations but computations; and computation requires a language of thought. This book offers a more cogent presentation and a fuller explication of a distinctive account of the mind, with various intriguing new features. The central role of compositionality in the representational theory of mind is revealed: most of what we know about concepts follows from the compositionality of thoughts. The book shows the necessity of a referentialist account of the content of intentional states, and of an atomistic account of the individuation of concepts. Not least among the new developments is the book's identification and persecution of pragmatism as the leading source of error in the study of the mind today.},

	abstract = {An individual or whole we understand to be whatever is represented in any given discourse by signs belonging to the lowest logical type of which that discourse makes use. What is conceived as an individual and what as a class is thus relative to the discourse within which the conception occurs. One task of applied logic is to determine which entities are to be construed as individuals and which as classes when the purpose is the development of a comprehensive systematic discourse.The concept of an individual and that of a class may be regarded as different devices for distinguishing one segment of the total universe from all that remains. In both cases, the differentiated segment is potentially divisible, and may even be physically discontinuous. The difference in the concepts lies in this: that to conceive a segment as a whole or individual offers no suggestion as to what these subdivisions, if any, must be, whereas to conceive a segment as a class imposes a definite scheme of subdivision—into subclasses and members.The relations of segments of the universe are treated in traditional logistic at two places, first in its theorems concerning the identity and diversity of individuals, and second in its calculus of membership and class-inclusion. But further relations of segments and of classes frequently demand consideration. For example, what is the relation of the class of windows to the class of buildings? No member of either class is a member of the other, nor are any of the segments isolated by the one concept identical with segments isolated by the other. Yet the classes themselves have a very definite relation in that each window is a part of some building. We cannot express this fact in the language of a logistic which lacks a part-whole relation between individuals unless, by making use of some special physical theory, we raise the logical type of each window and each building to the level of a class—say a class of atoms—such that any class of atoms that is a window will be included (class-inclusion) in some class that is a building. Such an unfortunate dependence of logical formulation upon the discovery and adoption of a special physical theory, or even upon the presumption that such a suitable theory could in every case be discovered in the course of time, indicates serious deficiencies in the ordinary logistic. Furthermore, a raising of type like that illustrated above is often precluded in a constructional system by other considerations governing the choice of primitive ideas.},

	abstract = {A historical look at the manner in which recursion was introduced into linguistics, including how it was used thereafter, shows that Chomsky, the scholar who popularised the use of recursive techniques in linguistics, has always understood this notion to be a central feature of generative procedures, much as it was treated in mathematical logic in the 1930–50s. Recursion is the self-reference property that underlies all types of recursive functions; recursive definitions (or definitions by induction), in addition, justify every stage of the computations effected by computational procedures such as Post production systems or set-operators like merge, making recursion the central feature of a generative grammar. The contemporary literature, however, has confused this recursive property of a grammar with other constructs, such as self-embedded sentences, self-embedding operations, or certain rewriting rules, thereby obscuring the role of recursion in the theory of language. It is here shown that this is the result of the literature implicitly endorsing a number of unwarranted conflations, four of them analysed here. It is concluded that most of the discussion on the centrality and uniqueness of recursion in human language and/or general cognition has been confusing and confused for very fundamental reasons; a story of conflations, in a nutshell.},

Apart from meta-linguistic knowledge and strategies and other aspects, such as age, motivation, environmental factors, previously learnt languages might influence or even determine the success of a language learner’s endeavor to learn a next language.In this paper, we reflect on what syntactic knowledge multilingual learners have when starting to learn a next language and what role accumulated linguistic knowledge plays in the development of a subsequent language over time. In other words, here we attempt to define what S0 for multilingual acquisition is.The paper concludes that the temporal sequencing of full-fledged language grammars in the mind of a learner prior to the acquisition of Ln loses its validity as the fundament to model syntactic development in language acquisition. It follows that Aronin’s (Dominant language constellation as a method of research. Contribution to the thematic symposium: multi-competence and dominant language constellations.

One of the major findings in acquisition, related to the truth conditions of the quantifiers, has been that children go through at least two stages of non-adult interpretation of the quantifier every (Philip, 1995). More recently, researchers (Noveck, 2001; Gualmini et al., 2001; Chierchia, 2001b; Papafragou \& Musolino, 2003) have shown that children understand quantifiers logically in a context where adults derive scalar implicatures (for example, some vs. all ). In this paper, I focus on the third component of the determiner meaning, presupposition. Using Felicity Judgment Task, I argue that children acquire the lexical presupposition earlier than the implicated presupposition, and that the acquisition path of implicated presupposition resembles more closely that of scalar implicatures.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates young children's knowledge of scalar implicatures and downward entailment. In previous experimental work, we have shown that young children access the full range of truth-conditions associated with logical words in classical logic, including the disjunction operator, as well as the indefinite article. The present study extends this research in three ways, taking disjunction as a case study. Experiment 1 draws upon the observation that scalar implicatures (SIs) are cancelled (or reversed) in downward entailing (DE) linguistic environments, e.g., in the scope of negation (Chierchia, 2000). Experiment 2 was designed to determine if scalar implicatures are used by children, like adults, to influence the interpretation of disjunction in non-DE contexts, yielding an implicature of exclusivity for disjunction. Whereas adult controls always rejected assertions of the form A or B in positive (non-DE) contexts in which assertions of the form A and B were also true, many children accepted assertions with disjunction in such contexts. To provide an interpretation to the findings from Experiment 2, a new experimental technique was devised and used in Experiment 3. The new technique presents pairs of assertions to children, who are asked to judge which assertion is a 'better' description of the context. The findings from Experiment 3 demonstrated children's awareness that A and B is more informative than A or B in positive contexts, where both statements are true. Taken together, the findings of Experiments 2 and 3 are compatible with the view that some children lack the computational resources to apply scalar implicatures when a single assertion is presented alone (see Reinhart, 1999).

Experiment 1 presented scalar sentences without context. Pragmatically infelicitous but logically correct sentences with some were the crucial test items. Results indicate that L2 learners derive scalar implicatures significantly more often than the native English and Korean speakers. Experiment 2 used statements in the rich context of stories presented with pictures and text. The pragmatically felicitous responses of the learners increased to over 90\%. It is concluded that scalar implicatures present no problem to L2 learners, and that linguistic pragmatic principles are universal. These results are interpreted in light of two influential accounts of scalar implicature calculation and situate them among recent L2A theories.},

	abstract = {In this article a description is given of a model of the bilingual speaker. The model presented is based on Levelt's (1989) 'Speaking' model, which sketches a framework in which a number of (highly autonomous) information processing components are postulated. The main characteristics of the model are that it is incremental and parallel, and that lower level processing is more automatized than higher level processing. An attempt is made to adapt the Levelt model for bilingual processing. Given the firm empirical basis of the (monolingual) version of the model, it was intended to change the model as little as possible. It is concluded that the first component, the conceptualize is probably partly language-specific and partly language-independent. Further it is hypothesized that there are different formulators for each language, while there is one lexicon where lexical elements from different languages are stored together. The output of the formulators is sent to the articulator which makes use of a large set of non-language specific speech motor plans. The adapted version of Levelt's model appears to provide a good explanation of various aspects of language production, especially with respect to codeswitching and the storage and retrieval of lexical elements, and it may suggest a useful direction to take in future research on language processing in bilinguals.},

	abstract = {In general, discussion of cross-linguistic influence has focussed almost exclusively on the role of L1 in L2 production, both in the form of crosslinguistic influence on the learner's interlanguag and in the form of language switches to the L1 during L2 production As yet, there has been little work done on the influence of a learner's other previously learned L2s in the acquisition of a new language (L3) The few studies that have been earned out on the role of L2 in L3 production however show that L2 does play an important role in L3 acquisition. This paper presents the results of ongoing research on non-adapted language switches, using data from a two-year longitudinal case study of an adult learner of L3 Swedish with L1 English and L2 German Our study is, based on 844 non-adapted language switches We indentified four main types of switch, three of which had pragmatic purpose, namely (1) EDIT (marking self-repair, beginning of turntake etc), (II) META (used for asides, to comment on L3 performance or ask for help) and (III) INSERT (use of non-L3 items to overcome lexical problems in L3), and the last of which we refer to as Without Idenufied Pragmatic Purpose (WiPP Switch, of ‘non-intentional switches’, Pouhsse and Bongaerts 1994) We found that While L1 English prevailed in EDIT, META and INSERT functions, almost only L2 German occurred in WIPP Switches Most of these WIPP Switches were function words We also noticed that a number of the English utterances used in INSERT function appeared to show German Influence, although this was not the case when English was used in META function Our results, show that in this case study of L3 acquisition, L1 and L2 play different roles We suggest that L2 German, Which was shown to be the non-L3 language predominantly used to supply material for lexical construction attempts in the L3 (Williams and Hammarberg 1994), is activated in Parallel to the L3 interlanguage, underlying L3 production and even L1 production We refer to this as the default supplier role L1 English, on the other hand, is more seldom used in lexical construction attempts in the L3 or activated in parallel but rather is kept separate from the L3 and used largely with a metalinguistic function We refer to this as the INSTRUMENTAL role We propose a developmental model of L3 production based on de Bot's (1992) model of bilingual speech production but involving role assignment to the background languages, such that only the language which has been assigned the role of DEFAULT SUPPLIER' is regularly activated in parallel to the L3 interlanguage Over time, these two roles are largely taken over by the L3 itself We suggest that these roles also exist in L2 acquisition but since there is only one background language, this takes over both roles and over distinctions between them collapse.},

	abstract = {A recent controversy in second language acquisition research concerns the extent to which adult non-native intuitions differ from adult native intuitions at  advanced and near-native levels of competence (end-states). Two (apparently) contradictory findings pervade the L2 literature: while some studies reveal that learners can indeed achieve native-like intuitions, other findings show that they display near-native and optional intuitions. In short, there is a debate about whether adult non-native interlanguage grammars converge with (or diverge from) adult native grammars. 
The first type of studies (convergence) focuses on constructions that are claimed to be part of the innate principles of Universal Grammar (UG), which typically represent a poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) phenomenon. The second type (divergence) normally focuses on parameterisable functional features where the L1 and L2 values differ. 
In this study I test whether this is the expected trend in advanced non-native Spanish acquisition, i.e., that learners show convergent knowledge where UG principles are involved, but divergent knowledge where parametric values differ between the native and the target language. 
In particular, I investigate the distribution of overt and null pronominal subjects in Spanish, which is constrained by a principle of UG, the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC), and by a language-specific constraint, the Contrastive Focus Constraint (CFC). Similarly, the distribution of Subject-Verb (SV) and Verb-Subject (VS) word order is constrained by two principles of UG, namely, the Unaccusative Hypothesis (UH) and the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (UTAH), and by a language-specific constraint, presentational focus.  
Results from two experiments (pronominal distribution and word order distribution) reveal that English learners of L2 Spanish and Greek learners of L3 Spanish show convergent (native-like) intuitions with respect to the principles of UG (OPC and UH/UTAH), while showing divergent (near-native and optional) intuitions in cases where the strength of the parameterisable focus head differs between their L1 and their L2/L3 Spanish (contrastive and presentational focus environments).},

In the present paper, two experiments with a multilingual speaker who had suffered aphasia are reported. The first experiment provides data about inter-language activation during natural conversations; the second experiment examines performance on a word-translation task. Asymmetric patterns of inter-language interference and translation are evident. These patterns are influenced by age of language learning, degree of language recovery and use, and prevalence of shared lexical items. We conclude that whereas age of language learning plays a role in language recovery following aphasia, the degrees of language use prior to the aphasia onset and of shared vocabulary determine the ease with which words are accessed. The findings emphasize the importance of patterns of language use and the relations between the language pair under investigation in understanding lexical connections among languages in bilinguals and multilinguals.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses grammatical gender in Norwegian by bringing together data from first language acquisition, Norwegian heritage language, and dialect change. In all these contexts, gender is often claimed to be a vulnerable category, arguably due to the relative non-transparency of gender assignment. Furthermore, the feminine gender is in the process of being lost in many Norwegian dialects, as feminine agreement forms (for example, the indefinite article) are merged with the masculine. The definite suffix, in contrast, is quite stable, as it is acquired early and does not undergo attrition/change. We argue that the combined data provide evidence that gender and declension class are separate phenomena, and we outline a possible formal analysis to account for the findings.*},

	abstract = {This paper investigates possible attrition/change in the gender system of Norwegian heritage language spoken in America. Based on data from 50 speakers in the Corpus of American Norwegian Speech (CANS), we show that the three-gender system is to some extent retained, although considerable overgeneralization of the masculine (the most frequent gender) is attested. This affects both feminine and neuter gender forms, while declension class markers such as the definite suffix remain unaffected. We argue that the gender category is vulnerable due to the lack of transparency of gender assignment in Norwegian. Furthermore, unlike incomplete acquisition, which may result in a somewhat different or reduced gender system, attrition is more likely to lead to general erosion, eventually leading to complete loss of gender.},

The essential guide to studying first and second language acquisition, it will be used on courses in linguistics, modern languages and developmental psychology"-- "This is an introduction to the study of the human Language Making Capacity. More accurately, it is a textbook presenting research questions and research results referring to specific manifestations of this capacity in monolingual and bilingual first language acquisition and child and adult second language acquisition.

To address this contentious and empirically challenging issue, we systematically tested the predictions of a well-studied neurocognitive theory of language motivated by evolutionary principles. Multiple metaanalyses were performed to examine predicted links between language and two general-purpose learning systems, declarative and procedural memory. The results tied lexical abilities to learning only in declarative memory, while grammar was linked to learning in both systems in both child first language and adult second language, in specific ways. In second language learners, grammar was associated with only declarative memory at lower language experience, but with only procedural memory at higher experience. The findings yielded large effect sizes and held consistently across languages, language families, linguistic structures, and tasks, underscoring their reliability and validity. The results, which met the predicted pattern, provide comprehensive evidence that language is tied to general-purpose systems both in children acquiring their native language and adults learning an additional language. Crucially, if language learning relies on these systems, then our extensive knowledge of the systems from animal and human studies may also apply to this domain, leading to predictions that might be unwarranted in the more circumscribed study of language. Thus, by demonstrating a role for these systems in language, the findings simultaneously lay a foundation for potentially important advances in the study of this critical domain.},

This study investigates the extent of individual differences in adult native speakers' knowledge of a range of constructions as well as vocabulary size and collocational knowledge, and explores the relationship between these three aspects of linguistic knowledge and four nonlinguistic predictors: nonverbal IQ, language aptitude, print exposure and education. Individual differences in grammatical attainment were comparable to those observed for vocabulary and collocations; furthermore, performance on tests assessing speakers' knowledge of these three aspects of language was correlated (rs from 0.38 to 0.57). Two of the nonlinguistic measures, print exposure and education, were found to contribute to variance in all three language tests, albeit to different extents. In addition, nonverbal IQ was found to be relevant for grammar and vocabulary, and language aptitude for grammar. These findings are broadly compatible with usage-based models of language and problematic for modular theories.},

Its study may not only inform us about adult L2 acquisition, a major feat of human learning which is little understood, but it may also inform us about the nature of first language (L1) acquisition and about the nature of the hypothesized language faculty. Results of this work may also yield new insights concerning the interaction of the language component with other domains of human cognition. This is all possible because the study of adult L2 acquisition, in contrast to the study of L1 acquisition, involves learners who have already reached mature states both in terms of their L1s and overall cognition. This means that patterns of development that emerge in adult language learning cannot be attributed to a lack of access to a full set of language principles nor can they be attributed to deficits in general cognitive development. Thus, if we find commonalities in patterns between L1 and L2 acquisition, these similarities could be argued to follow from a set of commonly shared language principles and they would also suggest that the essential language faculty argued to characterize L1 acquisition also holds in adult L2 acquisition. Stated in another way, comparable patterns in L1 and L2 acquistion could be argued to follow from properties that hold of the language learning faculty itself as an independent domain of human cognition.},

	abstract = {IntroductionThe goal of developing a theory of second language (L2) acquisition based on a principled theory of language is not new. Two of the most well-developed approaches to the study of L2 acquisition contrastive analysis (CA) (Fries 1945; Lado 1957) and creative construction (CC) (Dulay \&amp; Burt 1974) were each based upon a version of an available theory of language. A traditional CA model, in which L2 acquisition is thought to consist of the learning of a fixed set of linguistic habits, was based upon a structuralist approach to language. A CC model of L2 learning, in which L2 acquisition is thought to be a creative rule-governed process, was based upon a version of a generative theory of language. Though CA and CC were each able to capture the sense of one important component of the L2 acquisition process – CA the role of the first language (LI) experience, and CC the role of principles of acquisition independent of the LI experience – neither succeeded in providing a principled framework within which a full account of the L2 learning process could be developed. The reasons for this failure, in the case of CA, had to do, in large part, with the nature of the linguistic theory upon which it was developed. Structuralist theories, with their behaviorist grounding, focussed on language as behavior. Such theories are known to have problems explaining how knowledge is acquired or put to use (Chomsky 1959,1986).Even though CC was articulated within a framework more consistent with current goals of linguistic theory, the imprecise formulation of the L2 model within this paradigm left it empirically untestable (see the review in Flynn 1985a).},

Results indicate that production tests principally evaluate a learner's developing structural competence in the L2. On the other hand, comprehension tests provide a less direct measure of structural competence and are significantly influenced by pragmatic context.Fifty-one adult Spanish speakers at three levels of ESL ability were tested in both their elicited imitation (production) and act-out (comprehension) of complex sentences that were structurally identical. The stimuli varied in terms of the pre- and post-posing of a subordinate adverbial when clause and in terms of the direction of pronoun anaphora (forward and backward). Results from the production test indicate a significant effect of directionality, i.e., a preference for forward pronouns in post-posed clauses at the intermediate level. Results from the comprehension test did not show a significant directionality constraint at any level. They did, however, demonstrate a significant effect due to the use of a biasing pragmatic lead. Such findings are comparable to those found in early first language acquisition (Lust, Loveland, \& Kornet, 1980). Implications of these findings for experimental methodology are discussed.},

First, I argue that the strength of Arendtian natality is its rootedness in an ontology of uniqueness, and a commitment to human plurality and relationality. Next, I trace with Cavarero three critical concerns regarding Arendtian natality, namely that it is curiously abstract; problematically disembodied and sexually neutral; and dependent on a model of vulnerability that assumes equality rather than asymmetry. This last issue is further developed in the final section of the essay, where I examine the idea that birth, for Cavarero, becomes the very concept by which we can distinguish and normatively differentiate acts of care and love from acts of wounding and violence. Upholding the normative distinction here depends on a conceptual distinction between vulnerability and helplessness. To maintain the ethical potential of the scene of birth, I argue that we have to insist on the very characteristics Cavarero attributes to it—ones, as this essay aims to show, that are ultimately missing in the Arendtian account thereof.},

	abstract = {It’s right there in the Book of Job: “Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.” Suffering is an inescapable part of the human condition—which leads to a question that has proved just as inescapable throughout the centuries: Why? Why do we suffer? Why do people die young? Is there any point to our pain, physical or emotional? Do horrors like hurricanes have meaning?   In Seven Ways of Looking at Pointless Suffering, Scott Samuelson tackles that hardest question of all. To do so, he travels through the history of philosophy and religion, but he also attends closely to the real world we live in. While always taking the question of suffering seriously, Samuelson is just as likely to draw lessons from Bugs Bunny as from Confucius, from his time teaching philosophy to prisoners as from Hannah Arendt’s attempts to come to terms with the Holocaust. He guides us through the arguments people have offered to answer this fundamental question, explores the many ways that we have tried to minimize or eliminate suffering, and examines people’s attempts to find ways to live with pointless suffering. Ultimately, Samuelson shows, to be fully human means to acknowledge a mysterious paradox: we must simultaneously accept suffering and oppose it. And understanding that is itself a step towards acceptance.   Wholly accessible, and thoroughly thought-provoking, Seven Ways of Looking at Pointless Suffering is a masterpiece of philosophy, returning the field to its roots—helping us see new ways to understand, explain, and live in our world, fully alive to both its light and its darkness.},

The centrality of this theme can be considered by now a given,1 and not only in the feminist studies that focused on it first,2 as they identified there a way of doing philosophy that was not homologated to the canons of the logocentric tradition.3 Given how birth recurs in Arendt’s works, one can, however, speak of it on the same level as a dominant theme, inasmuch as the multiple problems of politics, existence, Judaism, education, etc., that our authoress addresses all reconnect sooner or later to birth. An example is her constant reference to Augustine as the author who most emphasized the specifically innovative character of birth. The continuity of her reference to Augustinian thought, present from her PhD thesis4 to The Life of the Mind,5 is indicative of how the human capacity to be an initium, in the precisely causal and not only temporal sense, represents for this authoress the focus of a constellation of problems inherent in the human condition. And in fact, it is in Active Life: The Human Condition — written in close relationship to the thought of Heidegger, her first “professor,”6 and published in the mid-1950’s7 by when she had finalized her detachment from the forms of currently reigning socialization — that, undertaking a renewed comparison with the question of existence, Arendt fully explicates the topic of natality.

Two trilingual, one bilingual and a control group (n = 119) rated experimental items embedded in context, presented in a written and aural format on a computer screen.

In a self-paced reading experiment, native speakers of Russian and English, as well as (low) intermediate L3 learners of English, read ambiguous relative clauses (RC) and decided on their attachment interpretation: high attachment (HA) or low attachment (LA). In the two-by-two design, linguistic decision-making was prompted by lexical semantic cues vs. a structural change caused by a certain type of matrix verb. The results show that whenever a matrix verb caused a change of syntactic modification, which entailed HA, both native and non-native speakers abandoned the default English-like LA and chose HA. Lexical semantic cues did not have any significant effect in RC attachment resolution. The study provides experimental evidence in favor of the similarity of native and non-native processing strategies. Both native speakers and L3 learners of English apply structural processing strategies and show similar sensitivity to a linguistic prompt that shapes RC resolution. Native and non-native processing is found to be prediction-based; structure building is performed in a top-down manner.},

Fifty-nine L1 English, Dutch and Russian advanced to near-native L2 speakers of German were tested on their ultimate attainment of case marking, subject–verb agreement and gender concord. Different off-line and on-line tasks were employed. Cross-linguistic and cross-experiment comparisons of native and non-native performance show that native-like ultimate attainment of L2 inflection is possible for postpubescent learners in L2 grammar and L2 processing. Non-target-like L2 inflection is systematically related to L1 transfer and limitations in L2 processing efficiency. In conjunction, these findings argue against a critical period for morphosyntax in L2 acquisition; rather, they suggest that non-native and native grammars and processing systems are fundamentally identical, with L2 systems being computationally less efficient due to L1 influence.},

Data elicited by an information-gap task performed by 39 learners of L2 Germanat two points in time are used to describe the sequence of acquisition of three obligatory word order rules. A comparison of this sequencewith that reported for naturalistic learners of German revealed no difference, despite the fact that the order in which the rules were introduced and the degree of emphasis given to the rules in the instruction differed from the naturalistic order. The classroom learners, however, did appear to be more successful than the naturalistic learnersin that they reached higher levels of acquisition in a shorter period of time. The results of this study support the claim that the classroom and naturalistic L2 acquisition of complex grammatical features such as word order follow similar routes. They also suggest that classroom learners may learn more rapidly. These findings are discussed with reference to both theories of L2 acquisition and language pedagogy.},

While the choice of word order (V2 or non-V2) in Tromsø is dependent on information structure, the Kåfjord speakers produce considerably more non-V2 in questions with monosyllabic wh-elements. The majority of questions with multisyllabic wh-constituents, on the other hand, occurs with V2. This synchronic variation is given a diachronic analysis within a Split-CP model of clause structure and a cue-based approach to acquisition and change, where an economy principle (head preference) also plays an important role. Furthermore, an information structure drift from V2 to non-V2 is argued to cause the cue for verb movement to fall below a critical level in the input to children, the result being that V2 only survives in lexically marked cases in Kåfjord, i.e. with the verb ‘be’.},

Focusing on NOR-2, we will show that the choice of word order (V2 or V3) is dependent on the information status of the subject. We will argue that this can be related to the position subjects have in the IP domain, more specifically that given subjects occur in Spec-AgrSP and new information subjects occur in Spec-TP. Furthermore, based on the split-CP analysis we will account for the word order differences in the three Norwegian dialect types by postulating a parameterized requirement for filling different C heads. The analysis proposed will also account for why the complementizer som is inserted in NOR-2 and NOR-3 whenever the wh-constituent is the subject of the clause. In addition, on the basis of a comparison with Norwegian we will provide an analysis of the English subject/oblique asymmetry in wh-questions, i.e., of the fact that there is no auxiliary inversion/do-support in main clause subject wh-questions.},

The central goal of that project was to investigate and, if possible, refine the notion of parameter of Universal Grammar, as it has been understood in generative theory since roughly 1980, by looking carefully at the phenomena associated with one of the best-known and most widely discussed examples of a parameter: the null-subject parameter (NSP). The authors discuss the phenomena from English and various Romance languages which originally motivated the postulation of the NSP. Next, the authors summarise the main kinds of null-subject system that have been identified in the comparative-syntax literature. This leads us to briefly propose a hierarchical model of parameter schemata which combines the notion of micro-and macroparameters.},

The chapter suggests that Merge constitutes the sole computational operation in narrow syntax and proposes a No Tampering Condition (NTC) to prevent Merge from making internal changes to the syntactic objects (SOs) to which it applies. It first reviews some recent and ongoing work in the general framework of the so-called Minimalist Program before turning to the theory of phases, the Inclusiveness Condition, and the Phase Impenetrability Condition. It also discusses two forms of Merge, external merge and internal merge, the latter of which is driven by edge features of lexical items.},

A given idea A need be left as primitive in a system only so long as we have discovered between A and the other primitives no relationship intimate enough to permit defining A in terms of them; hence the more the set of primitives can be reduced without becoming inadequate, the more comprehensively will the system exhibit the network of interrelationships that comprise its subject-matter. Of course we are often concerned less with an explicit effort to reduce our basis than with particular problems as to how to define certain ideas from others. But such special problems of derivation, such problems of rendering certain ideas eliminable in favor of others, are merely instances of the general problem of economy. Thus it is quite wrong to think of the search for economy as a sort of game, inspired by an abnormal love of superficial neatness. Some economies may be relatively unimportant, but the inevitable result of regarding all economy as trivial would be a willingness to accept all ideas as primitive at the outset, making a system both unnecessary and impossible.},

In particular, we test the hypothesis, developed on the basis of assumptions regarding syntactic modularity, that the changes in L1 syntax will be restricted to the interface with the conceptual /intentional cognitive systems. The area of investigation is the domain of grammatical subjects in Greek and Italian. More specifically, we tested the participants on the production and interpretation of null and overt subjects, and of preverbal and postverbal subjects. We also elicited grammaticality judgments on subject extraction and subject position in various syntactic contexts. In this paper we report on the results of one of the production tasks (of preverbal and postverbal subjects) and two interpretation tasks. Attrition effects are found in the production of preverbal subjects in the Greek group whereas Italian speakers show attrition effects in the interpretation of overt pronominal subjects. We argue that these results are in the right direction, that is, that semantic features are vulnerable in language attrition whereas syntactic options remain intact.},

	abstract = {Stagnant atmospheric conditions can lead to hazardous air quality by allowing ozone and particulate matter to accumulate and persist in the near-surface environment. By changing atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, global warming could alter the meteorological factors that regulate air stagnation frequency. We analyze the response of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) air stagnation index (ASI) to anthropogenically enhanced radiative forcing using global climate model projections of late-21st century climate change (SRESA1B scenario). Our results indicate that the atmospheric conditions over the highly populated, highly industrialized regions of the eastern United States, Mediterranean Europe, and eastern China are particularly sensitive to global warming, with the occurrence of stagnant conditions projected to increase by 12–25\% relative to late-20th century stagnation frequencies (3–18 + days yr−1). Changes in the position/strength of the polar jet, in the occurrence of light surface winds, and in the number of precipitation-free days all contribute to more frequent late-21st century air mass stagnation over these high-population regions. In addition, we find substantial inter-model spread in the simulated response of stagnation conditions over some regions using either native or bias corrected global climate model simulations, suggesting that changes in the atmospheric circulation and/or the distribution of precipitation represent important sources of uncertainty in the response of air quality to global warming.},

Given this lack of consensus, it is not surprising that the distribution of adnominal adjectives had remained an unsolved problem in the study of intrasentential codeswitching. In this paper, we propose a solution by exploiting the formal model of intrasentential codeswitching developed in Mahootian (1993), which is based on the null hypothesis that codeswitching sequences are not subject to structural constraints beyond the general principles of phrase structure that govern monolingual sequences. We first show that a blanket treatment of adnominal adjectives as heads is untenable, and then argue that the distribution of adnominal adjectives described in the codeswitching literature provides a new source of evidence in favor of the view that there are two distinct classes of adjectives. We review a number of alternative treatments proposed in the codeswitching literature and show that our analysis is preferable. © 1995.},

It is argued that the age at which a bilingual child begins to produce in her weak language has a profound impact on the type and the frequency of code-mixing. Language mixing in young bilinguals is very different from code-switching in adult bilinguals. The roots of code-switching can be seen in the early use of language choice as a function of addressee.

The discussions and analyses in the study are carried out within the theoretical framework provided by the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) model and its two submodels: the 4-M model and the Abstract Level model. The data are analyzed for the presence of bilingual production, such as codeswitching (CS), convergence, and bare forms. Because different types of morphemes become salient at different levels of the abstract lexical structure, some are less accessible and therefore more vulnerable as language attrition progresses. A structural definition of convergence based on the interaction of the abstract lexical structures of the languages participating in the bilingual speech is developed. The analysis shows that bare forms are produced as a result of both CS and convergence in the abstract structure. Bare forms represent an intermediate stage of language loss, preceded by integrated CS forms and followed by convergence. Overt CS is defined as the presence of morphemes from two varieties; these may be nontarget forms, including bare forms. Overt CS alone is found not to be indicative of language attrition since it does not, by it self, lead to the projection of parts of the abstract structure of the Embedded Language onto the grammatical frame of the Matrix Language (ML). Covert CS (convergence) may occur alone or along with overt CS (nontarget forms, including bare forms). Covert CS is, indeed, an indicator of language attrition in progress since it is a result of a composite Matrix Language. © 2000, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives: Numerical indices developed by Guzman et al. that helped characterize code-switching (CS) patterns in Spanish–English bilingual corpora, were tested on a Hindi–English bilingual corpus. Two main research questions were addressed: first, how does Hindi–English compare with Spanish–English, and second, are there measurable differences in broad CS patterns between older and younger speakers? Methodology: Television interviews of Hindi movie (Bollywood) personalities were transcribed and coded for Hindi and English lexemes. Bespoke software in Python was used to calculate the required indices, which provided information on variables such as the level of language mixing, switching probability, and the distributions of single-language spans. Further indices, such as mean span length and an approximate ratio of insertions to alternations were also calculated. Data and analysis: The indices calculated for the Hindi–English corpus broadly match those calculated for Spanish–English. Statistically significant differences between the older and younger group were detected for some key indices, with older speakers generally using less English. High levels of intra-group variability may be responsible for some indices not showing statistically significant diachronic change. Conclusions: The Guzman et al. indices suggest that Hindi–English and Spanish–English CS resemble each other in certain ways. There have been broad changes in Hindi–English CS patterns over the last few decades, but there are indications that the CS behaviour of individual speakers might change in different ways. Originality: This is the first study to systematically and quantitatively investigate age-related differences in Hindi–English CS, using naturalistic speech in semi-controlled conditions. Implications: The quantitative indices investigated in this study can be used to compare CS behaviour in different language pairs, and can also help detect diachronic changes in CS patterns. © The Author(s) 2021.},

One might ponder if there is enough evidence to justify a cessation to future research on the topic or, alternatively, how the field could proceed to better understand the phantom-like appearance of bilingual effects. Herein, we attempt to frame this appearance at the crossroads of several factors such as the heterogeneity of the term ‘bilingual’, sample size effects, task effects, and the complex dynamics between an early publication bias that favours positive results and the subsequent Proteus phenomenon. We conclude that any definitive claim on the topic is premature and that research must continue, albeit in a modified way. To this effect, we offer a path forward for future multi-lab work that should provide clearer answers to whether bilingualism has neurocognitive effects, and if so, under what conditions.},

In following with this proposal, the current study examines whether two types of Spanish-English bilinguals are equally sensitive to the (un)grammaticality of Spanish-English code-switching at the subject-predicate and auxiliary-verb phrase boundaries. Twenty-five heritage Spanish speakers and forty-four L2 Spanish learners completed an Audio Naturalness Judgment Task in which they judged grammatical and ungrammatical Spanish-English code-switching at these two syntactic junctions. Results indicate that the L2 Spanish speakers and the heritage bilinguals, regardless of their self-reported exposure to code-switching, correctly differentiated between grammatical and ungrammatical switches, suggesting that they have implicit knowledge of code-switching grammaticality which falls out from syntactic knowledge of the two languages.},

Nevertheless its status in current syntactic theory is highly controversial. This book is a defence of the parametric approach to linguistic variation, set within the framework of the Minimalist Program. It discusses syntactic variation in the light of recent developments in linguistic theory, focusing on issues such as the formal nature of minimalist parameters, the typology of null-subject language systems and the way in which parametric choices can be seen to underlie the synchronic and diachronic patterns observed in natural languages.},

The author begins by sketching some of the evidence that children can use sentences to guide verb learning, and then considers this and other evidence in relation to several possible mechanisms for syntactic bootstrapping. The author argues that little or no language-specific syntactic knowledge is needed to give the child an initial sentence-structural guide for interpreting verbs. Instead, based on a partial or presyntactic description of sentences, children can obtain information about verb meaning essentially by structural analogy, aligning a sentence representation with a conceptual representation that shares its skeletal structural properties. The author then explores how learners might construct the simple structured representations of sentences needed to use this simple mechanism for syntactic bootstrapping.

Yet the issues here are quite perplexing because, at least to first inspection, heard words seem to map only very inexactly onto the child's observations of objects, scenes, and events.  In light of such difficulties, we tried to get some insight into how the child constructs the right mappings between words and the world by examining a situation in which the opportunities to observe the world are diminished: the case of langauge learning by congenitally blind children.  There is an evidently unshakable tradition which asserts that the blind must in principle be defective in their learning—of language, of space, and more.  We shall document that these a priori opinions cannot survive confrontation with the reality of language learning in congenitally blind children. Blind learners not only learn the forms of language but their meanings as well; their speech cannot be characterized as replete with "verbalisms" (the clinical term for blind learners' putative use of certain words as "sound without meaning").

	abstract = {Adult language comprises three interrelated systems, phonological, lexicogrammatical (vocabulary, morphology, syntax), and semantic. Language development studies in the 1960s focused mainly on the lexicogrammatical level; they were also predominantly psycholinguistic in their orientation. More recently, interest has extended into semantics; the present paper is concerned with the learning of meaning, and proposes a complementary approach in sociolinguistic terms. The paper suggests a socio-semantic interpretation of language development, based on the intensive study of one child, Nigel, from 9 months to 2½ years. Nigel first developed (Phase I) a two-level system, having sounds and meanings but no words or structures, in which the meanings derived from the elementary social functions of interaction with others, satisfaction of needs and the like. This continued to expand for 6–9 months, at which time the child entered the stage of transition to the adult language (Phase II, corresponding to what is generally taken as the starting point). This was characterized by the interpolation of a lexicogrammatical level between meaning and sound, and by the mastery of the principle of dialogue, the adoption and assignment of speech roles. It was also marked by a generalization of the initial set of social functions to form a basic opposition between “language as learning” and “language as doing.” The transition was considered complete when the child had effectively replaced his original two-level system by a three-level one and moved from monologue into dialogue; he then entered the adult system (Phase III). He could now build up the meaning potential of the adult language, and would continue to do so all his life. From a sociolinguistic point of view the major step consisted in once again reinterpreting the concept of “function” so that it became the organizing principle of the adult semantic system, being built into the heart of language in the form of the ideational (representational, referential, cognitive) and the interpersonal (expressive-conative, stylistic, social) components of meaning. All utterances in adult speech contain both these components, which are mapped on to each other by the structure-forming agency of the grammar. The original social functions survive in their concrete sense as types of situation and setting, the social contexts in which language serves in the transmission of culture to the child},

But language development is learning how to mean; and because human beings are quintessentially creatures who mean (i.e., who engage in semiotic processes, with natural language as prototypical), all human learning is essentially semiotic in nature. We might, therefore, seek to model learning processes in general in terms of the way children construe their resources for meaning—how they simultaneously engage in “learning language” and “learning through language.” A number of characteristic features of language development, largely drawn from systemic-functional studies of infancy, childhood, and early adolescence, offer one possible line of approach towards a language-based interpretation of learning.},

	abstract = {A recent controversy in second language acquisition research concerns the extent to which adult non-native intuitions differ from adult native intuitions at  advanced and near-native levels of competence (end-states). Two (apparently) contradictory findings pervade the L2 literature: while some studies reveal that learners can indeed achieve native-like intuitions, other findings show that they display near-native and optional intuitions. In short, there is a debate about whether adult non-native interlanguage grammars converge with (or diverge from) adult native grammars. 
The first type of studies (convergence) focuses on constructions that are claimed to be part of the innate principles of Universal Grammar (UG), which typically represent a poverty-of-the-stimulus (POS) phenomenon. The second type (divergence) normally focuses on parameterisable functional features where the L1 and L2 values differ. 
In this study I test whether this is the expected trend in advanced non-native Spanish acquisition, i.e., that learners show convergent knowledge where UG principles are involved, but divergent knowledge where parametric values differ between the native and the target language. 
In particular, I investigate the distribution of overt and null pronominal subjects in Spanish, which is constrained by a principle of UG, the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC), and by a language-specific constraint, the Contrastive Focus Constraint (CFC). Similarly, the distribution of Subject-Verb (SV) and Verb-Subject (VS) word order is constrained by two principles of UG, namely, the Unaccusative Hypothesis (UH) and the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (UTAH), and by a language-specific constraint, presentational focus.  
Results from two experiments (pronominal distribution and word order distribution) reveal that English learners of L2 Spanish and Greek learners of L3 Spanish show convergent (native-like) intuitions with respect to the principles of UG (OPC and UH/UTAH), while showing divergent (near-native and optional) intuitions in cases where the strength of the parameterisable focus head differs between their L1 and their L2/L3 Spanish (contrastive and presentational focus environments).},

In a series of penetrating essays, Chomsky cuts through the confusion and prejudice which has infected the study of language and mind, bringing new solutions to traditional philosophical puzzles and fresh perspectives on issues of general interest, ranging from the mind-body problem to the unification of science. Using a range of imaginative and deceptively simple linguistic analyses, Chomsky defends the view that knowledge of language is internal to the human mind. He argues that a proper study of language must deal with this mental construct. According to Chomsky, therefore, human language is a 'biological object' and should be analyzed using the methodology of the sciences. His examples and analyses come together in this book to give a unique and compelling perspective on language and the mind.},

We engage key questions, debates, and shifts within GenSLA such as focusing on the deterministic role of input in language acquisition, as well as expanding the inquiry to new populations and empirical methodologies and technologies used. The second goal is to highlight the place of GenSLA in the broader field of SLA. We argue that various theories of SLA are needed, showing that many existing SLA paradigms are much less mutually exclusive than commonly believed (cf.

Natural conversations between 21 American children (ranging in age from 1;10 to 2;8 and in MLU from 1.53 to 4.38) and their mothers were taped, transcribed, and analyzed to determine when American children understand that English requires subjects.

For Studies 1 and 3 we also used, for comparative purposes, transcripts of 5 Italian children, taped monthly for a year.

	abstract = {[Roland Barthes is "against" language in two senses of that word. His work struggles constantly "against" those levels of language—communication, symbolism—which create discourse within the subject. Internalized discourse creates alienations from Self and world in several ways. Two of the most serious are, 1) it establishes false linguistic unities within, which the subject then misrecognizes as the Self; and 2) it traps the subject into a system of infinite referrals and deferrals, which destroys the capacity for immediate experience of either Self or world. But simultaneously and paradoxically, Barthes presses "against" language as one would a lover. He finds in language a third level of meaning, a troisieme sens, where signifiers somehow "mean" but have no assignable signifieds. This level was called "style" in the early days of Writing Degree Zero and later "signifiance." Both perception and Self are immediately embodied in this level of language without elsewheres, and accession to it yields the bliss of unmediated experience of reality. This paper explores the ways in which Barthes 1 writing 1) works to disrupt those conventions of language which produce discourse and 2) attempts to accede to the level of the third meaning. For Barthes the ideal writing would be one in which discourse is a mere backdrop or occasion for the play of signifiance.]},

In an approach to this problem, we provided incubator-reared bees with opportunities to fly and see the sun only during the late afternoon. Then, on a cloudy day, we allowed bees to fly for the first time during the morning and early afternoon, and we observed how they oriented their waggle dances to indicate their direction of flight relative to the sun's position. The clouds denied the bees a direct view of celestial orientation cues and thus forced them to estimate the sun's position on the basis of their experience on previous evenings. During the test days, experience-restricted bees behaved during the entire morning as if they expected the sun to be in an approximately stationary position about 180 degrees from the average solar azimuth that they had experienced on previous evenings; then from about local noon onward they used the evening azimuth. This pattern suggests that honeybees are innately informed of the general pattern of solar movement, such that they can generate an internal representation that incorporates spatial and temporal features of the sun's course that they have never directly seen.},

	abstract = {In his foundational book, The Minimalist Program, published in 1995, Noam Chomsky offered a significant contribution to the generative tradition in linguistics. This twentieth-anniversary edition reissues this classic work with a new preface by the author. In four essays, Chomsky attempts to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences, with the essays formulating and progressively developing the minimalist approach to linguistic theory. Building on the theory of principles and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of languages is also restricted. Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation. The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional. All syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and keeping to very restricted conceptual resources. In the preface to this edition, Chomsky emphasizes that the minimalist approach developed in the book and in subsequent work "is a program, not a theory." With this book, Chomsky built on pursuits from the earliest days of generative grammar to formulate a new research program that had far-reaching implications for the field.},

We address both limitations with a dataset of unprecedented size (669,498 native and non-native English speakers) and a computational model that estimates the trajectory of underlying learning ability by disentangling current age, age at first exposure, and years of experience. This allows us to provide the first direct estimate of how grammar-learning ability changes with age, finding that it is preserved almost to the crux of adulthood (17.4 years old) and then declines steadily. This finding held not only for “difficult” syntactic phenomena but also for “easy” syntactic phenomena that are normally mastered early in acquisition. The results support the existence of a sharply-defined critical period for language acquisition, but the age of offset is much later than previously speculated. The size of the dataset also provides novel insight into several other outstanding questions in language acquisition.},

To understand language acquisition thus requires precise statements about these components and their interplay, stepping beyond the philosophical and methodological disputes such as the generative vs. usage-based approaches. I review several mathematical models that have guided the study of child language acquisition: How learners integrate experience with their prior knowledge of linguistic structures, How researchers assess the progress of language acquisition with rigor and clarity, and How children form the rules of language even in the face of exceptions. I also suggest that these models are applicable to second language acquisition (L2), yielding potentially important insights on the continuities and differences between child and adult language.},

Currently called the SAT Reasoning Test, this exam includes sections measuring reading, writing, and math skills considered necessary for college-level study. The results of the SAT and placement exams involve high-stakes decisions about test-takers, such as their acceptance to a university and/or exemption from coursework; hence, the consequences of inaccurate results may lead to unnecessary hardship for test-takers. Instructors, too, may indirectly suffer if they must accommodate very disparate levels of students in their classes as well as respond to students’ dissatisfaction with their course assignments. Thus, whenever assessments “serve as both door-openers and gate keepers” (Bachman \&amp; Purpura, in press), test users must be particularly vigilant in ensuring that test scores are interpreted accurately, and that tests are used as intended. This commentary focuses on test use and how it influences the fairness of decisions made on the basis of test scores. More precisely, I argue that adopting tests for purposes other than those for which they were created is not only irresponsible, but potentially unjust.},

A grammaticality judgment study suggests that RBs possess sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations, though to a lesser degree than fluent bilinguals. Low-proficiency RBs are sensitive only to the most basic grammatical properties. Case omission is most difficult to detect, but morphemes bearing incorrect features (case oversuppliance, number agreement mismatch) or ordered incorrectly (tense and agreement, tense and negation) are easier, and performance on incorrect ordering of morphemes is near target with the core agreement morpheme for all RBs. While receptive bilinguals show patterns of grammatical deficits, they also demonstrate clear knowledge of the basic properties of word structure in Inuttitut. This has implications both for the psycholinguistics of bilingualism and for language revitalization efforts.},

	abstract = {Abstract The term ‘receptive bilingualism/multilingualism’ is used for diverse populations, all of which understand a language without producing speech in it, but differ in the way this receptive ability was achieved and in the linguistic knowledge underlying it. In previous studies, not enough attention is given to the differences between types of receptive bilinguals (RBs); however, a thorough analysis of all types is necessary to understand the nature of receptive bilingualism and, consequently, language comprehension and production in general. I propose a classification of RBs based on the presence and nature of an acquisition process that led to receptive abilities. In this classification, RBs who comprehend a language mutually intelligible with one they know are distinguished from RBs with acquired knowledge. Within the former, RBs with and without previous exposure are distinguished. Within acquired types, RBs who comprehend a heritage language are distinguished from RBs who comprehend a second/foreign language.},

The structure of interest is adjective placement, which is the same in the L1 and the L3 (but not in the participants’ L2s).

We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

We conducted an fMRI experiment to evaluate the acquisition of syntactic features in a new language (Kazakh) for multilinguals and bilinguals. Results showed that the multilinguals who were more proficient in their second/third languages needed fewer task trials to acquire Kazakh phonology. Regarding group differences, the reduction in response times during the initial exposure to Kazakh were significantly larger for the multilinguals than the bilinguals. For the multilinguals, activations in the bilateral frontal/temporal regions were maintained at a higher level than the initial level during subsequent new grammar conditions. For the bilinguals, activations in the basal ganglia/thalamus and cerebellum decreased to the initial level each time. Direct group comparisons showed significantly enhanced activations for the multilinguals in the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus. These results indicate that both syntax-related and domain-general brain networks were more enhanced for the multilinguals. We also unexpectedly observed significant activations in the visual areas for the multilinguals, implying the use of visual representation even when listening to speech sounds alone. Because the multilinguals were able to successfully utilize acquired knowledge in an accumulated manner, the results support the cumulative-enhancement model of language acquisition.},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study examined whether prenatal exposure to either a tonal or a nontonal maternal language affects fundamental frequency (fo) properties in neonatal crying.
Study Design
This is a population prospective study.
Participants
A total of 102 neonates within the first week of life served as the participants.
Methods
Spontaneously uttered cries (N = 6480) by Chinese (tonal language group) and German neonates (nontonal group) were quantitatively analyzed. For each cry utterance, mean fo and four characteristic variation measures (fo range, fo fluctuation, pitch sigma, and pitch sigma fluctuation) were calculated, averaged for individual neonates, and compared between groups.
Results
A multiple analysis of variance highlighted a significant multivariate effect for language group: Wilks λ = .76, F(6, 95) = 4.96, P {\textless} .0001, ηp2 = .24. Subsequent univariate analyses revealed significant group differences for fo variation measures, with values higher in the tonal language group. The mean fo did not differ between groups.
Conclusions
Data regarding fo variation in infant cries have been suggested as providing critical insight into the maturity of neurophysiological vocal control. Our findings, alongside with auditive perception studies, further underscore the assumption of an early shaping effect of maternal speech, particularly fo-based features, on cry features of newborns. Further studies are needed to reexamine this observation and to assess its potential diagnostic relevance.},

We investigate this hypothesis in a new study of language development, aging, and pathology. Through interuniversity collaboration using a matched experimental design and task, we compare production of complex sentences containing relative clauses by normal monolingual children during normal development, healthy young adults, healthy aging adults, and aging adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a recognized potential harbinger of Alzheimer’s disease. Our results refute the regression hypothesis in this area and lead to potential syntactic markers for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease and predictions for future brain imaging analyses.},

While many researchers have analyzed code-switching behaviors to better understand more about the language processes in bilingual children, few have examined how code-switching behavior affects a child's linguistic competence. This study thus sought to examine the relationship between code-switching and linguistic competency in bilingual children. Fifty-five English–Mandarin bilingual children aged 5 to 6 years were observed during classroom activities over five days (three hours each day). A number of different word roots and mean length of utterance for both languages, and a number of code-switched utterances for each child, were computed. English receptive vocabulary scores were also obtained. Additionally, teachers rated children's English and Mandarin language competencies approximately six months later. Correlational and hierarchical regression analyses support the argument that code-switching does not indicate linguistic incompetence. Instead, bilingual children's code-switching strongly suggests that it is a marker of linguistic competence.},

The effects of animation on identification of graphic symbols for verbs were studied using the Autism Language Program Graphic Symbols Set in children diagnosed with mild-to-severe autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 3 and 7 years.

Method

The participants were randomly assigned to an animated symbol condition or a static symbol condition. Static symbols were spliced from the animated symbols to ensure that the symbols differed only in terms of the absence or presence of movement. The participants were asked to identify a target symbol among foils given the spoken label.

Results

There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to chronological age, autism severity, and receptive target verb knowledge. An independent t test revealed that animated symbols were more readily identified than static symbols.

Conclusions

Animation enhances the identification of verbs in children with autism spectrum disorder. Clinicians are encouraged to take advantage of animation when introducing graphic symbols representing verbs. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.},

Participants were 40 adult learners of French at varying levels of proficiency, studying in a university immersion context. Speech performances were collected on three different types of narrative tasks. Four utterance fluency measures were extracted from each performance. Eleven untrained judges rated the speech performances and we examined which utterance fluency measures are the best predictors of the scores awarded by the raters. The mean length of runs and articulation rate proved to be the most influential factors in raters’ judgments, while the frequency of pauses played a less important role. The length of pauses was positively related to fluency scores, indicating a prominent cross-linguistic variation specific to French. The relative importance of the utterance measures in predicting fluency ratings, however, was found to vary across tasks.},

The listeners were also assessed for phonological memory (serial recognition), attention control (trail making), and musical aptitude. Results showed that music majors assigned significantly lower scores than nonmusic majors solely for accentedness, particularly for low ability second language speakers. However, the ratings were not significantly affected by individual differences in listeners’ phonological memory and attention control, which implies that these factors do not bias listeners’ subjective judgments of speech.

Participants decided if phonemes were present in the target language name of a picture, phonemes of non-target language translations resulted in longer response times and more false alarms compared to phonemes not present in any translation (Colomé, 2001). The second language (English) interfered more than the first (Dutch) when trilinguals monitored in their third language (French). In Experiment 2, 95 bilinguals learned an artificial language to explore the possibility that the language from which a bilingual learns a third language provides practice managing known-language interference.

The chapter describes how this view gives rise to parameter hierarchies, and sketches five such hierarchies. It then investigates typological features of some example languages, showing how the complexity of these features can be calculated as a function of their position on the parametric hierarchies.

Second, exceptions to this are restricted to post-nominal position (e.g., N-Dem-Num-Adj, but not, for instance, Adj-Num-Dem-N). These observations have been argued to reflect constraints on cognition. Here we report on two experiments, providing support for this claim. We taught English- and Thai-speaking participants artificial languages in which the position of modifiers relative to the noun differed from their native order (post-nominal position in English, pre-nominal in Thai). We trained participants on single-modifier phrases, and asked them to extrapolate to multiple modifier phrases. We found that both populations infer relative orders of modifiers that conform to the tendency for closest proximity of adjectives, then numerals, then demonstratives. Further, we show that Thai participants, learning pre-nominal modifiers, exhibit a stronger such preference. These results track the typology closely and are consistent with the claim that noun phrase word order reflects properties of human cognition.

	abstract = {This article investigates how adult Korean-speaking learners of English interpret English definite descriptions (the book, the books) and demonstrative descriptions (that book, those books). Korean lacks articles, but has demonstratives, and it is hypothesized that transfer leads learners to (initially) equate definites with demonstratives. Following J Hawkins (1991), Roberts (2002) and Wolter (2006), it is assumed that definite and demonstrative descriptions have the same central semantics of uniqueness, but differ in the domain relative to which uniqueness is computed: while the book denotes the unique book in the discourse, that book denotes the unique book in the immediately salient situation. A written elicited production task and a picture-based comprehension task are used to examine whether Korean-speaking learners of English are aware of this distinction. The results indicate that learners distinguish definites and demonstratives, but not as strongly as native English speakers; low-proficiency learners are particularly likely to interpret definite descriptions analogously to demonstrative descriptions, in both tasks. These results pose interesting conceptual and methodological questions for further research into the second language acquisition of article semantics.},

The study further documents and offers explanations for widespread underrepresentation of Jespersen's work by American structuralists in the 1940s and 1950s and by historians of American structural linguistics.

Data from child-directed speech are investigated with respect to frequencies of particular clause types and examples requiring exceptional word orders (related to specific lexical elements). Child language data from Norwegian are presented to show that mixed V2 is acquired early, regardless of the different input frequencies, even in exceptional cases. Within a split-CP model of clause structure, it is argued that the search domain for word order cues is not the overall input, but restricted to individual clause types and other linguistically relevant categories and subcategories that children must be sensitive to in the acquisition process. Consequently, several micro-cues for V2 are identified. With respect to language change, this means that diachronic development should affect one micro-cue at a time, giving the impression that change is gradual.},

In this paper, these findings are accounted for by a model of micro-cues, a generative approach to language acquisition arguing that children are sensitive to fine syntactic distinctions from early on. The micro-cues are small pieces of abstract syntactic structure resulting from parsing the input. This means that UG provides children with principles, features, and the ability to parse, but not the micro-cues themselves, which are considered to be part of the knowledge of a specific language. The model also considers children’s errors to generally be due to economy and the language acquisition process to be development in small steps, from specific to more general knowledge.

It surveys a wide variety of functionalist and formalist theoretical approaches, from dependency grammars and Relational Grammar to Lexical Functional Grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and Minimalism. It describes the traditional tests for constituency and the formal means for representing them in phrase structure grammars, extended phrase structure grammars, X-bar theory, and set theoretic bare phrase structure. In doing so it provides a clear, thorough, and rigorous axiomatic description of the structural properties of constituent trees. Andrew Carnie considers the central controversies on constituent structure. Is it, for example, a primitive notion or should it be derived from relational or semantic form? Do sentences have a single constituency or multiple constituencies? Does constituency operate on single or multiple dimensions? And what exactly is the categorial content of constituent structure representations? He identifies points of commonality as well as important theoretical differences among the various approaches to constituency, and critically examines the strengths and limitations of competing frameworks. This new edition includes textual revisions as well as a new final chapter and ensures that Constituent Structure remains the definitive guide to constituency for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, as well as theoretical linguists of all persuasions in departments of linguistics, cognitive science, computational science, and related fields.},

	abstract = {This book, by leading scholars, represents some of the main work in progress in biolinguistics. It offers fresh perspectives on language evolution and variation, new developments in theoretical linguistics, and insights on the relations between variation in language and variation in biology. The authors address the Darwinian questions on the origin and evolution of language from a minimalist perspective, and provide elegant solutions to the evolutionary gap between human language and communication in all other organisms. They consider language variation in the context of current biological approaches to species diversity -- the "evo-devo revolution" -- which bring to light deep homologies between organisms. In dispensing with the classical notion of syntactic parameters, the authors argue that language variation, like biodiversity, is the result of experience and thus not a part of the language faculty in the narrow sense.

Our goal in this article is to survey and evaluate what is known about the linguistic, socio-affective, neurobiological and cognitive underpinnings of the second language (L2) learning process in older individuals, the extent to which L2 acquisition may be seen as contributing to healthy and active ageing, and how these phenomena are to be approached scientifically, methodologically and pedagogically. Our view is that a developmental enterprise as complex as L2 learning in senior adulthood and its effects in later life cannot be explained by a single theory or set of principles. Furthermore, we take it that L2 acquisition in the third age needs to be regarded not just as a goal in itself but as a means of promoting social interaction and integration, and that it is partly through the stimulation of social well-being that its cognitive effects may potentially be observed.},

The impetus for the growth in testing speaking during the 19th and 20th centuries is twofold. Firstly, in educational settings the development of rating scales was driven by the need to improve achievement in public schools, and to communicate that improvement to the outside world. Chadwick (1864, see timeline) implies that the rating scales first devised in the 1830s served two purposes: providing information to the classroom teacher on learner progress for formative use, and generating data for school accountability. From the earliest days, such data was used for parents to select schools for their children in order to ‘maximize the benefit of their investment’ (Chadwick 1858). Secondly, in military settings it was imperative to be able to predict which soldiers were able to undertake tasks in the field without risk to themselves or other personnel (Kaulfers 1944, see timeline). Many of the key developments in speaking test design and rating scales are linked to military needs.},

However, rating scales used in performance assessment have been repeatedly criticized for being imprecise and therefore often resulting in holistic marking by raters (Weigle, 2002). The aim of this study is to compare two rating scales for writing in an EAP context; one `a priori' developed scale with less specific descriptors of the kind commonly used in proficiency tests and one empirically developed scale with detailed level descriptors. The validation process involved 10 trained raters applying both sets of descriptors to the rating of 100 writing scripts yielded from a large-scale diagnostic assessment administered to both native and non-native speakers of English at a large university. A quantitative comparison of rater behaviour was undertaken using FACETS. Questionnaires and interviews were administered to elicit the raters' perceptions of the efficacy of the two types of scales. The results indicate that rater reliability was substantially higher and that raters were able to better distinguish between different aspects of writing when the more detailed descriptors were used. Rater feedback also showed a preference for the more detailed scale. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for rater training and rating scale development.},

One hundred and forty examinees' responses to six TAST tasks were scored analytically on these three aspects of speech. G studies were used to investigate the dependability of the analytic scores, the distinctness of the analytic dimensions, and the variability of analytic score profiles. Raters' perceptions of dimension separability were obtained using a questionnaire. It was found that the dependability of analytic scores averaged across six tasks and double ratings was acceptable for both operational and practice settings. However, scores averaged across two tasks and double ratings were not reliable enough for operational use. Correlations among the analytic scores by task were high but those between delivery and topic development were lower. These results were corroborated by raters' perceptions. When averaged across tasks or task types, correlations among the analytic scores were very high, and the profiles of scores were flat. The utility of analytic scoring is discussed, considering both score dependability and whether analytic scores provide diagnostic information beyond that provided by holistic scores.},

	abstract = {The study of pragmatic competence has gained increasing importance within second language assessment over the last three decades. However, its study in L2 language testing is still scarce. The aim of this paper is to research the extent to which pragmatic competence as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) has been accommodated in the task descriptions and rating scales of two of the most popular Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) at a C1 level: Cambridge’s Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) and Trinity’s Integrated Skills in English (ISE) III. To carry out this research, OPI tests are first defined, highlighting their differences from L2 pragmatic tests. After pragmatic competence in the CEFR is examined, focusing on the updates in the new descriptors, CAE and ISE III formats, structure and task characteristics are compared, showing that, while the formats and some characteristics are found to differ, the structures and task types are comparable. Finally, we systematically analyse CEFR pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scale descriptors of both OPIs. The findings show that the task descriptions incorporate mostly aspects of discourse and design competence. Additionally, we find that each OPI is seen to prioritise different aspects of pragmatic competence within their rating scale, with CAE focusing mostly on discourse competence and fluency, and ISE III on functional competence. Our study shows that the tests fail to fully accommodate all aspects of pragmatic competence in the task skills and rating scales, although the aspects they do incorporate follow the CEFR descriptors on pragmatic competence. It also reveals a mismatch between the task competences being tested and the rating scale. To conclude, some research lines are proposed.},

	abstract = {The linguistic data to which children are exposed appear to be insufficient to determine, by themselves, the linguistic knowledge that children eventually attain. The gap between available experience and attained competence forms what has been called the logical problem of language acquisition. The approach to a solution, which has been followed in linguistic theory over the past two decades, is to suggest that the gap is bridged by an innate Universal Grammar: a system of knowledge of what a human language can be and innate domain-specific procedures for arriving at a grammar. The classic statement is that of Chomsky:A consideration of the character of the grammar that is acquired, the degenerate quality and narrowly limited extent of the available data, the striking uniformity of the resulting grammars, and their independence of intelligence, motivation and emotional state, over wide ranges of variation, leave little hope that much of the structure of language can be learned by an organism initially uninformed as to its general character.(Chomsky 1965:58)Adults may also learn foreign languages. Abstractly, the logical problem of adult foreign language learning is the same as for childhood language learning: explaining how acquisition takes place, given the limitations of the data. But the problem is also different, in important ways. Foreign language learning differs in degree of success, in the character and uniformity of the resulting systems, in its susceptibility to factors such as motivation, and in the previous state of the organism: The learner already has a knowledge of one language and a powerful system of general abstract problem-solving skills.},

	abstract = {Several studies on L3 lexicon, and recently also some on L3 syntax, have convincingly shown a qualitative difference between the acquisition of a true L2 and the subsequent acquisition of an L3. Some studies even indicate that L2 takes on a stronger role than L1 in the initial state of L3 syntax (e.g. Bardel and Falk, 2007; Rothman and Cabrelli Amaro, 2010). In this article we further investigate syntactic transfer from L1/L2 to L3 in learners at an intermediate level of proficiency in the target language. Data have been obtained from 44 learners of German as L3, testing the placement of object pronouns in both main and subordinate clauses in a grammaticality judgement/correction task (GJCT). The learners constitute two groups (both n = 22): One group has English as L1 and French as L2 and the other group has French as L1 and English as L2. This particular combination of background languages allows us to pinpoint the source of transfer, since object placement is pre-verbal in French and post-verbal in English, this being applied in both main and subordinate clauses. In target language (TL) German, however, the object placement varies between pre-verbal in the sub clause and post-verbal in the main clause. The two groups behave differently as to both acceptance and rejection of the test items (60 grammatical and ungrammatical main and sub clauses with object pronouns). This difference is significant and can be ascribed to their L2s, respectively. Our results thus show that the L2 transfers into the L3 even at an intermediate level, and on the basis of this we claim a strong role for the L2 status factor.},

In this cross-modal priming study, we examined the online processing of Sluicing, an ellipsis whose antecedent is an entire clause: The handyman threw a book to the programmer but I don’t know which book the handyman threw to the programmerellipsis. To understand such an elliptical construction, the listener arguably must ‘fill in’ the missing material (“the handyman threw\_\_\_ to the programmer”) based on that which occurs in the antecedent clause. We aimed to determine the point in time in which reconstruction of the sluiced sentence is attempted and whether such a complex antecedent is re-accessed by the ellipsis. Out of the two antecedent constituents for which we probed, only the Object (programmer) was found active in the elliptical clause, confirming that an antecedent is attributed to the sluice in real time. Possible reasons for the non-observation of the Subject (handyman) are considered. We also suggest that ellipses are detected earlier in coordinated than subordinated sentences.},

I claim that the mechanisms they posit to save an ellipsis story have no role in an account of performance (an account of the processes of utterance interpretation). An argument against the enrichment approach from the indeterminacy of the content of subsentential utterances is discussed, and refuted, and it is shown how this indeterminacy is accommodated in a contextualist pragmatic theory.},

	abstract = {This paper centers on the nature of Spanish TP-ellipsis (e.g., Juan fue al cine y María también , lit. ‘Juan went to the cinema and Mary also’), paying special attention to its behavior in contexts of long extraction of the remnant of the elliptical site. The long extraction data provide further evidence that TP-ellipsis in Spanish behaves as Clitic Left Dislocation. In particular, TP-ellipsis is sensitive to adjunct and relative islands. These facts lead us to the question of why other cases of TP-ellipsis, namely, sluicing, can indeed repair islands. I show that an approach such as the one in Merchant (Linguistics and Philosophy 27: 661–738, 2004, Variable island repair under ellipsis, Cambridge University Press, 2008) is not able to derive this pattern and propose an alternative solution. Assuming that ellipsis and copy deletion form a natural class (Chomsky, A minimalist program for linguistic theory, MIT Press, 1993, Chomsky, The minimalist program, MIT Press, 1995), I argue that the presence or absence of island repair effects is derived as a matter of identity. Basically, a phrasal copy is elided under the same mechanism that applies in normal cases of ellipsis. A copy that is elided in a given syntactic cycle is not computed for the identity condition on ellipsis in a later cycle. By contrast, if a copy cannot be elided in a syntactic cycle, it has to be computed for identity reasons at the ellipsis cycle. Under the assumption that indefinites and traces of wh -phrases are identical for the purposes of identity, it follows that ellipsis under wh -sluicing can feed elision of the wh -copies in the elliptical gap when there is an explicit indefinite in the correlate. This is never the case with Spanish TP-ellipsis because the copies of a left dislocated remnant never have an identical correlate in the antecedent.},

Such reduction in use can be due to a change in the linguistic environment or to the termination of an instructional program. In either case, some other language (or languages) is or becomes the dominant one.The present article reports on a series of studies, all focusing on individual attrition of English as a second language (ESL) in an environment where Hebrew is the dominant language. The predictor variables discussed are age, sociolinguistic features, input variables, and linguistic variables. The attrition process affecting English as a second language in a Hebrew dominant context seems to exhibit two major trends of change in language use: (a) a greater variability in the application of peripheral and highly marked structural rules, and (b) lower accessibility of specific lexical items. In each of these trends one can identify a limited reversal of the acquisition process, particularly with young children (5–8-year-olds) as well as a typological transfer process from the dominant language.},

Subjects were Spanish-English children ranging in age from 7 to 12 years. Measures were obtained for nonverbal mental capacity, metaphor interpretation, verbal-conceptual repertoire, and linguistic proficiency in English and Spanish. Using a previously validated procedure, subjects' metaphor interpretations were scored for cognitive complexity. In both languages, metaphor score was higher in older than in younger children. Correlational analyses indicated that level of metaphor interpretation was most strongly related to cognitive-developmental variables that are interdependent across languages, that is, nonverbal mental capacity and verbal-conceptual repertoire. Variables that measure specific proficiency in a language were less strongly related to level of metaphor interpretation, and did not exhibit cross-language correlations. This pattern was clearly seen in results of exploratory factor analyses. The role of cognitive versus linguistic factors in metaphor development is discussed, as is the issue of interdependence versus independence across first and second languages.},

	abstract = {In this paper, various definitions of markedness are discussed, including the difference in the assumptions underlying psychological and linguistic approaches to markedness. It is proposed that if one adopts a definition derived from theories of language learnability, then the second language learner's prior linguistic experience may predispose him or her towards transferring marked structures from the first language to the second, contrary to usual assumptions in the literature that suggest that second language learners will avoid marked forms. To test this hypothesis, adult and child learners of French as a second language were tested using grammaticality judgment tasks on two marked structures, preposition stranding and the double object construction, which are grammatical in English but ungrammatical in French, to see if they would accept French versions of these structures. It was found that the second language learners did not accept preposition stranding in French but did accept the double object construction, suggesting that transfer takes place only with one of the two marked structures. In addition, the children took tests on these structures in their native language to see if they perceived them as in any sense psycholinguistically marked. Results show that they do not treat marked and unmarked structures differently in the native language. It is suggested that the concept of markedness may cover a range of phenomena that need to be further clarified and investigated.},

"The purpose of the present experiment was to develop, if possible, a discrimination of absolute vs. relative brightness in the ring dove. The general method of presenting pairs of stimuli differing in brightness was followed, but the usual procedure was varied in one important aspect. Instead of presenting always the same pair in the training and then testing by means of substitute pairs, two pairs were used throughout a long training series, one member of each being always the same in brightness value… the positive stimulus was shown at every exposure along with now a lighter and now a darker stimulus patch." The stimuli were Hering standard gray cards presented in a modified Yerkes-Watson discrimination apparatus. The results indicate "that discriminations are usually easier when based upon relative vs. absolute stimulus factors in the set-up… . The simultaneous presentation of stimuli in pairs seems to favor the use of relative cues in discrimination. When the problem is somewhat complicated, as in the present case, by the presentation of a different stimulus in connection with the standard in successive pairings, the animal comes to make use of absolute cues.

The principle involved goes by many names—associations, conditioning, growth of language ability, formation of concepts, generalization, transfer, and even trademark infringement. Subjects were required to memorize a series of paired associates to the point of mastery. In the recall tests 24 hours later, novel stimuli exhibiting certain specified kinds and degrees of similarity were substituted for the original stimuli. The results were then compared with recall under the standard condition. The influence of three kinds of similarity was investigated: similarity of nonsense syllables with respect to spelling, word stimuli with respect to meaning, and visual patterns. For the syllables there is no conclusive evidence that the amount of recall varies significantly with the degree of similarity. Any alteration of any of the letters of the two syllables reduced the amount recalled. For the word meanings, "a response associated with a stimulus word tends to be aroused by a novel word having a similar meaning, and the likelihood of arousal varies directly with the degree of similarity." The same generalization holds for the visual figures used in the experiments. The author is of the opinion that similar effects can be obtained from diverse sense modalities, although he did not make the experiment.

It has been concluded that the lesser maturity of children leads to these results of prolonged drill. Such effects were not observed with adults.

The child was made to indicate whether or not he comprehended the meaning of opposition on two test words; if he did not, he was instructed on the first 10 of the 25 words used, the remaining 15 being given without any aid. It was found that children under the age of 6-6 do not understand the meaning of opposition, while approximately a fifth of the 6-7—7-0 group, and a third of the 7-1—7-6 year group do understand it. 58 S's, who did not understand the relation at the beginning, learned in an "insightful" way—there was no gradual acquisition, the learning curve dropping immediately from 100\% failures to 0\%. By treating the data by the method of constant stimuli, it is indicated that there is a probability of 0.5 that a child in the 5-3—5-9 age group will learn the relation.

The present study attempted to determine the relative parts played by these 2 factors, by comparing the amount of RI and PI (proactive inhibition). 24 college men served as S's. The material was "lists of 10 3-consonant units (learned) for 5 trials with and without the prior or subsequent learning of another maximally dissimilar or very similar list of consonant units for 5 trials, and then relearned… to a criterion of 2 successive errorless trials… ." The anticipation method was used. The results showed learning of the first lists under all conditions to be similar; scores on the second lists were like those on the first when they were dissimilar (different consonants). When the second list was similar, significantly fewer correct anticipations were made, but the amount of PI decreased as the learning proceded. The relearning after 20 min. showed highly significant amounts of both PI and RI to be present when the lists were similar, the amount of RI significantly exceeding the amount of PI. The results favor the suggested two-factor theory of RI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background: Semantic feature analysis (SFA) is a treatment approach aimed at enhancing lexical retrieval by improving access to the semantic network in speakers with aphasia. Although there are promising results on trained items, previous studies exploring the impact of SFA on verb production in monolingual speakers have shown mixed results for generalisation to untrained items and discourse. There are few published studies investigating SFA and action naming in multilingual speakers.Aims: The study explores the impact of SFA on trained and untrained verbs, semantics and syntax, and narrative production in the trained and untrained languages of a multilingual speaker (Japanese–English–German–Norwegian) with moderate non-fluent aphasia. Treatment was conducted in a late-acquired language (Norwegian).Methods \& Procedures: SFA was provided during an intensive schedule of about 22 hr of therapy, with approximately 10 hr per week over two and a half weeks. The treatment focused on the production of verbs in sentence contexts.Outcomes \& Results: Outcome measures include the Bilingual Aphasia Test, an action-naming test, and production of semi-spontaneous narratives.Outcomes in the treated language: Overall, the participant responded positively to the SFA treatment. The trained verbs improved significantly, but no transfer was observed to untrained verbs. There were no changes in the formal testing of semantics or syntax, but improvements were noted in narrative production.Cross-linguistic outcomes: Transfer to verbs in untreated German was evident. There were significant increases in the semantics and syntax in both English and German. The participant showed an improvement in discourse in English and German, although not in Japanese.Conclusions: SFA treatment in a late-acquired language can lead to gains in the treated language and transfer to both stronger and weaker languages, with different patterns for the various languages. This indicates that SFA may be a promising method for treating multilingual speakers with aphasia. The authors further advocate the use of narratives as an assessment tool. In addition to enhancing the ecological validity of the findings, the narratives provided information not obtainable from the other assessment tools for within- and cross-linguistic therapy gains for the participant.},

Rather than taking comparative words like more and less to be functional heads that head some Degree Projection, I claim that they are phrases (i.e. XPs) that undergo displacement within the adjective phrase to a Spec-position of a functional head that encodes ‘comparison’. In the spirit of Rizzi (1991), this Spec position is characterized as a criterial position. The empirical basis for my proposal is the phenomenon of Comparative Doubling, i.e. the co-occurrence of the bound comparative morpheme (-er) and the comparative word more in expressions like more safer.},

We show that while the nature of the subject plays a role in determining subject-verb agreement in the two varieties (in different ways), subject position is the overt structural manifestation of the differing properties of the subject, independent of which properties are relevant in the variety in question. Our proposal on subject positions, which goes beyond what Henry (1995) proposed for Belfast English, is able to capture clusters of properties not discussed by Henry, and thus more fully accounts for the range of micro-parametric variation we find. This paper thus provides support for a configurational approach to subject-verb agreement.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the role of previously acquired linguistic systems, Mazandarani and Persian, in the acquisition of third language (L3) English at the initial stages. The data have been obtained from 31 students (age 13–14 years), testing the placement of attributive possessives in a grammaticality judgment task, an element rearrangement task and an elicited oral imitation task. The participants consist of three groups: The first two groups have Mazandarani as the first language (L1) and Persian as the second language (L2), but differ from each other with respect to the language of communication, Mazandarani and Persian, respectively. The third group has Persian as the L1 and Mazandarani as the L2, with Persian as the language of communication. English and Mazandarani pattern similarly in the target structures. That is to say, possessors precede possessed nouns and possessive adjectives come before nouns. In contrast, in Persian, possessives occur post-nominally. The results of this study reveal that none of the proposals tested (e.g. the L1 Factor, Hermas, 2010, 2014a, 2014b; the L2 Status Factor, Bardel and Falk, 2007; Falk and Bardel, 2011; the Cumulative Enhancement Model (CEM), Flynn et al., 2004; the Typological Proximity Model (TPM), Rothman, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015) could account for the results obtained. This study provides support that at the initial stages of L3 acquisition, syntactic transfer originates from the language of communication, irrespective of order of acquisition.},

Three groups of bilinguals took part in this study: L1 Mazandarani/L2 Persian, with Mazandarani as the dominant language of communication, L1 Mazandarani/L2 Persian, with Persian as the dominant language of communication and L1 Persian/L2 Mazandarani, with Persian as the dominant language of communication. The results of a grammaticality judgment task and an element rearrangement task show that the predictions of the above-mentioned L3 transfer proposals were not realized. Instead, the dominant language of communication turns out to be the main source of syntactic crosslinguistic influence at the initial stages of L3 acquisition, irrespective of its status as an L1 or L2.},
